        "You will sometimes hear that deep learning only works when lots of data is available. This is in part a valid point: one fundamental \n",

        "However, what constitutes \"lots\" of samples is relative -- relative to the size and depth of the network you are trying to train, for \n",

        "potentially suffice if the model is small and well-regularized and if the task is simple. \n",
        "Because convnets learn local, translation-invariant features, they are very \n",
        "data-efficient on perceptual problems. Training a convnet from scratch on a very small image dataset will still yield reasonable results \n",
