Professor Nishanth,5,"An outstanding refresh of the base Kindle at an affordable price
","April 15, 2019","Original review: April 15, 2019, and two updates at the end of this review (April 16, 2019, and April 18, 2019)ORIGINAL REVIEW: April 15, 2019 (4/5 stars)UPDATED REVIEW: April 18, 2019 (5/5 stars)For background information, I am a professor and a tech geek. I have used Amazon devices for around eight years now. I currently own three Kindle e-readers (1 Kindle Touch, 1 Kindle Paperwhite 3rd generation, and 1 Kindle 10). I also own four Amazon Fire tablets (2015 Fire 7 -5th generation, 2019 Fire 7 – 9th generation, 2017 Fire HD 8 - 7th generation and 2018 Fire HD 8 –8th generation). Please note that I have traded-in some of the dated versions of the above-listed products to get upgraded versions (more on this under the “Saving Money on Purchases” section).Below is my summary of the “all-new Kindle” (Kindle 10th generation). I have spent the past few days playing around with the Kindle, reading from it, and reading other online reviews about this version to ensure the comprehensiveness and accuracy of information provided in this review. For reference purposes, this Kindle model was last refreshed in 2016. This model is the lowest-end basic flagship model of the Kindle e-reader.THE BOX: The Kindle device, a quick-start guide, and a USB cord. The item arrived sealed well. Please note that Amazon does not provide a wall adapter. Also, the Kindle box is smaller than the Paperwhite box.Availability: Black and White are the base colors variants. Additionally, Kindle fabric covers can be purchased for $29.99 in 4 different colors: Charcoal Black, Cobalt Blue, Punch Red, and Sandstone White from Amazon. I wouldn’t recommend these overpriced covers. There are several other quality and aesthetically pleasing covers that can be found on Amazon that are affordable, well rated, and function better.Summary of key aspects that have changed:- Price increase of $10 from the prior version- An adjustable backlight composed of 4 LEDs that helps readers with reading both indoors and outdoors. I love this feature. This feature alone justifies the additional $10 price increase in my opinion.- Updated design- Latest e-ink technology for better contrast that helps makes the text crisper. The text is crisper than prior version (see images) but not as crisp as higher end models.Things that have not changed from prior Kindle model:- Battery life remains the same- Charge time remains the same- Glare-free display- Option to hear Audible books through Bluetooth headphones or speakers.- Screen size remains the same at 6 inch- Storage remains the same at 4GB- Warranty remains the same: 1-year limited warranty and service along with product purchase. An additional warranty should be separately purchased if deemed necessary.Technical specs:- 167 pixel per inch (PPI) capacitive touch display (please note that though the PPI value remains the same as the prior model, there is sharper contrast because of the new e-ink technology used in the newer model)- 6-inch screen- Bluetooth- LED(s): 4 LED- Storage: 4 GB- Size: 6.3” x 4.5” x 0.34” (160 x 113 x 8.7 mm). As compared to the prior model, there is a 2mm reduction in width and 4 mm reduction in depth/height).- Weight: 6.1 oz (As compared to prior Kindle 8, there is a 0.4 oz increase in weight).Comparison between Kindle 10 (this version – 2019 release) referred to as Kindle below and Kindle Paperwhite (10th generation-2018 release – mid-tier model):- Charge: Kindle holds 4 weeks of charge while Kindle Paperwhite holds 6 weeks of charge- Connectivity: Kindle only has Wi-Fi option while Kindle Paperwhite offers Wi-Fi or Wi-Fi + Cellular Connectivity- Cost: Kindle costs $89.99 while Kindle Paperwhite costs $129.99 though previous sales were present that offered the item for $89.99 which can be stacked (please read below section on saving money for Kindle purchases)- LEDs: Kindle has 4 LEDs while Kindle Paperwhite has 5 LEDs- PPI: Kindle has 167 PPI while Kindle Paperwhite has 300 PPI- Water resistance: Kindle has no IPX8-rating (basically not water-resistant) while Kindle Paperwhite has the IPX8-rating (i.e., it allows submersion in 2 meters of fresh water for up to one hour).- Storage: Kindle offers 4GB storage while Kindle Paperwhite offers additional storage (8 GB or 32 GB)- Design: Kindle doesn’t have the flush front design while Kindle Paperwhite does Display size: remains the same (6 inches).-Total size: Even though the display size (previously mentioned) remains the same the specs of the items are different. Kindle: 10 6.3” x 4.5” x 0.34” (160 x 113 x 8.7 mm) while Kindle Paperwhite: 6.6” x 4.6” x 0.3” (167 x 116 x 8.18 mm).- Weight: Kindle 10 weighs 6.1 oz while Kindle Paperwhite Wi-Fi: 6.4 oz (182 g) Wi-Fi + Free Cellular Connectivity: 6.8 oz (191 g).I have refrained from comparing the Kindle Oasis in this review with the Kindle 10 because it is the highest-end model and if a consumer is looking at this model, then it is highly unlikely they are considering the Kindle Oasis. Besides, the Kindle Oasis costs around 3 times the amount of the Kindle 10 and 2 times the cost of the Kindle Paperwhite. Consequently, it would not be a fair and/or necessary comparison for this review.Some useful features on Kindle readers (not a comprehensive list):- Accessibility features: VoiceView screen reader (works through Bluetooth audio) and provides directions to help visually impaired readers to navigate through the device and read books with text-to-speech (this feature is only available in the English language). Additionally, to help visually impaired readers, Kindle also includes the ability to adjust the font size, font face, line spacing, and margins.- Smart Lookup (quickly check the default dictionary). The default, New Oxford American Dictionary and Oxford Dictionary of English (both from Oxford University Press).- Supports the following content formats: Kindle Format 8 (AZW3), Kindle (AZW), TXT, PDF, unprotected MOBI, PRC natively; HTML DOC, DOCX, JPEG, GIF, PNG, PMP through conversion; Audible audio format (AAX).- Users can review Wikipedia to understand word meanings better.- Integration with Goodreads (Amazon-owned book database).- Option to highlight words on the screen- Pdf and word documents can be sent to Kindle through email after a Kindle-specific email address is created.- Provides the option to share word or texts and additional commentary by the user.- Add a note regarding the word.- Translate a word from English to 16 languages.- Whispersync (sync progress across Kindle devices and apps)- X-Ray tool, which provides detailed information on key content in the book (i.e. “bones of the book”).Testing:Speed: Comparable to prior modelsWi-Fi: I was able to connect to the Wi-Fi network and use the experiential browser without any technical difficulties. The process was pretty straightforward.Saving money on purchasing the Kindle:- The initial purchase with a promo discount entitles you to a free 3-month Kindle Unlimited subscription ($29.97 value). After 3-months subscription will auto-renew at $9.99 (this promo discount can be taken out at any point in time). This makes this purchase a worthwhile purchase with additional savings.- The cost for the Kindle will be $109.99 (without special offers). Customers can also disable special offers later by paying $20 if they purchase the Kindle with special offers ($89). Personally, I would recommend going the route of getting the special offers and then disabling it. The special offers only appear when the Kindle is locked/asleep and are non-intrusive. I have 6 kindles all of which have special offers and have never had an issue. However, if the user does not like the special offers, you can purchase the $89 kindle and then remove the special offers (which might probably end up saving you a few dollars because there are no taxes for disabling offers).- Customers should also know that they can easily trade-in their prior Kindle for Amazon gift cards ($5-$25) and also receive a 25% discount towards their new Kindle.- My recommendation would be to purchase this item during a sale event (for instance, Amazon Prime day is coming up in July). The customer can get around $30 off, and then stack the trade-in and the 25% discount to get this item for a minimal cost (maybe you can snag it for $30-$40 if everything is applied correctly). However, one thing to keep in mind is that Amazon might decide to remove the trade-in gift card and 25% discount at any point.Conclusion:To sum up, my review, this is the base version of the Kindle. No bells and whistles, but it does the job. I absolutely love the Kindle LEDs in this model. It makes a world of difference for night reading specifically when my family is in bed, and I don’t have to get up to turn on/off the house lamp and make a ton of noise. The bottom line is that the Kindle e-readers are incontestably the best e-readers currently in the market. This Kindle follows in the same trajectory as prior versions.April 16, 2019:  UPDATE # 1I would personally recommend the Kindle Paperwhite (mid-tier model) as opposed to this Kindle 10 (the model reviewed) for a few more dollars. This can be purchased after following the cost-saving suggestions previously listed. My reasons are several other features like higher resolution (300 PPI vs. 167 PPI), more LEDs (5 vs. 4), water resistance (IPX-8 rating), larger storage (8 or 32 GB), and a cellular option for higher-end models will give the edge for customers looking for more options. However, the Kindle 10 does well for a base entry model.April 18, 2019:  UPDATE # 2After additional testing, I have given the Kindle 10, 5/5 stars in my review (instead of the initial 4/5 stars). I did consider docking down ½ a star for no increase of PPI for this version (167 PPI). However, please note that the e-ink quality has significantly improved and the LEDs make a world of difference, so this is Kindle is much better (factoring in reader comfort and quality) than the prior Kindle model even though both have the same PPI. Besides, this is the base version. What more can one expect for $89? Additionally, please note that the PPI is not a big issue for those that don’t regularly use the device for reviewing images, graphs, pictures, manga, illustrations, etc. Please review my picture (uploaded) comparison between text of the Kindle Paperwhite 3rd gen and Kindle 10 for comparison purposes. It is hard to see any distinction on a cursory observation.Please also note that several resources were used in the compilation of this review, but most of this review was based on my personal testing of the product.Whenever I make any purchase, I try to do a thorough and accurate job with the review. My reviews are my honest and comprehensive assessment of the product. I always post future updates and corrections based on new information if deemed necessary. Additionally, I always include photos of products to verify both that I purchased this product and to back up appropriate claims in the review.

Beverly K,3,"Base Kindle gets an upgrade
","April 15, 2019","The pros: I like that you have a choice of colors and that it comes with a front light. It's small and easy to carry around. If you've never had a Kindle before or never had one higher than the base, you won't notice the 167 ppi difference between it and the Paperwhite and the Oasis.The cons: If, however, you're like me and you have an Oasis, you'll immediately notice how much less crisp the letters and pictures are.Don't get me wrong. It's a good price for a starter Kindle, especially with lights now. For someone who's looking for the best reading experience they can get without spending too much money, it's a good choice.However, for a few dollars more, they can get a Paperwhite with better resolution, waterproofing, and more storage (2x more for the base Paperwhite model).So what should you get? If you're more concerned with saving money, go for the Kindle Basic. Otherwise, about thirty dollars more gets you a big improvement.
"
Gwaredd Thomas,1,"Lower ppi - Not good.
","April 15, 2019","I wouldn't purchase this product for the following reason: my 3rd Gen. Kindle has 300 ppi and this supposed ""new"" one has only 167 ppi so what gives?
"
Lynn,5,"Greatly Improved Basic Kindle
","April 15, 2019","Don't buy into the petty negative reviews. The improvements to the basic Kindle are great! I've been reading on mine the past several days and I'm extremely impressed. The lighting is the brightest, whitest and most even I've seen. It's comfortable to hold, easy to read, and just as responsive as my Oasis and my husband's Paperwhite. Highly recommend!
"
A.B.,4,"Pleasant updates to the ""base"" Kindle
","April 15, 2019","I had a Kindle touch years ago and had stopped using it. But I want to be able to focus on reading and not pop-ups from other apps so I bought this new Kindle to avoid the distractions of reading on my phone.The device is smaller than both my original Kindle touch and my husband's Kindle Paperwhite. I was able to quickly get connect to the internet and begin downloading Kindle books I checked out via Overdrive. The device can be held in one hand comfortably, and it's lightweight enough to feel quite portable without appearing flimsy.This Kindle has some buggy-feeling holdovers from previous generations: occasional leftover pixels during page/screen pages. However, I find the touch screen to be responsive without being jumpy. The bottom/power button sometimes takes an extra push to activate, or perhaps just needs me to focus a bit more. I don't mind the ""special offers"" and generally ignore them completely, yes, this is a generally annoying feature, but I'd rather spend that $20 on books. The backlight can be adjusted to read outdoors or in your bedroom in the dark (handy if your partner nags about keeping a booklight on).Another reviewer commented on the PPI. Personally, as I don't use the device for pictures/illustrations/detailed charts, I frankly don't care. The images that appear in the special offers are clear enough, and the default sized print is crisp and clean and I have no issues reading without my glasses. If you frequently read books that are illustration/graphic-heavy, you may prefer a Paperwhite or other device.I'll adjust my review if my sentiments change but for now I am very happy with my new Kindle.
"
Karen E.,4,"Not too bad!
","April 15, 2019","I've been reading on this for a few days now.  It's a little bit smaller than my regular Paperwhite, but the size doesn't bother me any.  I like the smaller size.  I purchased it without special offers as I don't need to see all of that. I'm an avid reader and read A LOT.  I haven't noticed a difference in battery life between this and my Paperwhite.  I have to charge that one daily too.  As I said, I read A LOT.  The front lighting is awesome.  I love that.  Comparing this one with my Paperwhite together with all the settings set, all the same, this one is a little brighter.  The only complaint I have is that when I touch the screen to change the page, I end up having to touch it twice to get the page to turn.  I'm hoping an upgrade will fix this.  All in all, I do like this one a lot.  It isn't perfect, but I do like it.Update:  05/04/2018:Still sticking with my previous review.  Battery update:  If you want to make your battery last longer, I recommend going through your device settings and reading options settings and turning every off that you aren't interested in.  Whispersync?  Turn it off.  I saved a lot of battery life by turning this off alone.  Word Wise, vocabulary builder - all turned off unless you're interested in using those features.  Reading options,  I only have the Page refresh turned on.  All other features are turned off.  Highlight menu - I turned all of that off.  Brightness level - I have that turned down to 12.  I hope this helps.  I noticed quite a difference when I turned some of this stuff off.Update:  07/02/2019:Just wanted to drop a note that there has been an update since I purchased this and it did indeed fix the touchscreen issue I was having.  I rarely have to touch the screen twice to get the page to turn now.  It's much better than it used to be.

CR,5,"First Time Kindle User
","April 15, 2019","This is the first Kindle I have ever owned or used for more than a couple seconds. My current employer actually told me to pick one up, and I could have chosen any Kindle I wanted. After reviewing the choices I decided to purchase this one, despite it being the cheapest. Honestly, I’m quite thankful.I wanted something of a small size, and a device that would be comfortable and easy to hold with both or either individual hand. I do not need to store a million books, nor do I plan to read in a river, or while taking a shower. If that changes, then I’ll update you on the water resistance of this device ;)As far as the actual devices goes, it is a nice size, capable of shoving into a small pocket in a bag, and is easy for me to palm and hold in a variety of ways. It is extremely light, and I could easily hold this for hours. The touch screen is responsive and flipping pages is easier and faster than I anticipated, while also avoidable when just holding the Kindle to read. I was hesitant about the lack of physical buttons, and although I still wished they were present (e.g. on the sides), I lack no confidence that they will soon be forgotten. Since I read a good bit of technical books, and like to take notes, I was wondering how well this would function. Although typing up paragraphs would be challenging, I was pleasantly surprised with the responsiveness. I will probably leave shorter notes and markers on my Kindle and elaborate more when on a computer or tablet. Although it is certainly not a smartphone or computer, it superseded my expectations.I do not have experiences to compare against, being my first Kindle, nonetheless the screen itself is bright and clear, whites being a light gray, and blacks being… well, dark. I did not find an option to invert the colors (font white, background black), which was unfortunate. I also find it odd the power button is on the bottom. I definitely foresee this being bumped while resting against a surface. At this point, I am also a bit disappointed this does not use USB-C. I am guessing Amazon is saving this for a newer, more expensive device, but honestly, I feel all devices like this moving forward really should have this.Having freedom in my choice here, I am thankful I chose this Kindle variant, and given the price point, I am doubtful anyone would complain once they held it in their hands. Any shortcomings I do have, and minor and I am doubtful they will be an ongoing annoyance. Definitely recommend.

Joseph S. Agerkis,3,"skips pages
","April 15, 2019","This is a problem I have with other Kindles including Paperwhite and Fire. Every 10 pgs or so instead of going to next pg it skips 2 or more pgs or sometimes freezes altogether. Wish this could be corrected. Very annoying.
"
Joanne,5,"Great basic Kindle — no bells, no whistles, just books
","April 15, 2019","I held on to my first-gen touchscreen Kindle for a long time because the Paperwhite and Oasis upgrades had more features than I need and often were poorly reviewed. So I jumped on this new lighted version of the basic. Pleasantly surprised with the lighted screen, battery life (I read in Airplane mode), and smaller overall size with the same screen size. If you’re looking for a way to carry your books with you everywhere you go, this is the best deal.
"
Fixedgear60,5,"Everything you need and nothing you don't
","April 16, 2019","I have owned multiple kindles, paperwhite (returned due to blurry screen), Voyage  and latest Oasis.  This is my favorite of the bunch.  Screen is crisp (no extra layer of glass) 167dpi is fine for long form reading.  If I need high def/color ... use my ipad. Grey scale images and text are crisp.  This is the lightest and smallest kindle to date which is the most important feature along with backlighting that is even.  I have set the backlighting to a comfortable lighting for evening reading (and forget)  and during the day rely on wonderful reflective screen for a more natural reading experience.  The kindle is very responsive and at a wonderful price that you do not mind bringing it everywhere and do not worry about loosing it.Well done amazon!!!!

Jamie,2,"7th generation vs this new one
","May 6, 2019","Let me add some updates here for people who seem to be confused. I used the 7th generation paper white I happen to have in my purse at the time this one was delivered and I use that to compare this model with. Yes, this is a basic reader, however, I still stand by my review in the fact that it is worth the extra cost vs this cheaper base. It is that simple, this product is subpar, and not the quality that Amazon usually offers even in their base products. It is that simpleSeriously Amazon, is this thing a joke? Lets start off with me comparing this to the 7th generation Kindle I had with me. Screen size is exactly the same. The 7th generation is slightly larger, which I actually like cause the new one is so small, it is actually uncomfortable to hold.The 7th generation touch screen is remarkably more responsive than the newest kindle I just received. I am beyond disappointed so far with it. In fact after registering it, and comparing it to my old one, i noticed, my old one which is the same GB size, actually has more memory available, 7 gen - 2.58 gb free vs. newest 2.26 gb free? Guess they need that extra space to cram more ads in there...but who am I to judge, I did buy it, didn't I? So here is the deal, basically, there is NO screen size difference, in fact, Amazon seems to have just shrunk the outer case, and sold me a worse kindle when compared to the previous version. The touch screen really is subpar. It is far from responsive and quick like the 7th generation. To add the icing on this cake, I see the waterproof kindle is on sale today for what i bought this not so great thing for. So i guess i am a little sore. Breakdown:7th generation vs. this new oneActual screen size: exactly the samePhysical size: 7th generation is larger, actually working it its favor making it easier to handle.Lights - Excatly the sameBattery - Again, I'm finding no difference in performanceTouch screen- 7th generation wins by long shot, responsive, quick. New kindle - Delayed, harder to get it to respondFinal thoughts - stay away. Not worth it. Amazon needs to step up their quality for this one seems to be utterly lacking.

Mozzy,1,"No power adapter - SAD
","July 15, 2019","Dear Amazon. It’s 2019 and it’s sad that you sell a gadget without a power adapter just so you can sell it separately at a cost. So technically, the advertised price looks cheaper but the buyer can’t use the device without spending more to buy a power adapter. That’s really greedy and deceitful. It’s like selling a brand new car without a battery.
"
Ravi Pendkar,2,"full of ads that cannot be turned off
","April 15, 2019","This device came packed with ads and promotional material that cannot be easily turned off. I tried to turn off the 'subscription' in my Amazon account for this device. The result is a vague - 'there was an error processing your request, try later' type message. Also, too many features that are trying to update your every page turn and click back to Amazon, not sure if these will slow down the device, but it was a chore going through all these settings disabling most of them. Too much work on a brand new product that you just unpacked. The only reason I bought this device was because of the 'easy on the eyes' screen - even there, I notice the page turns all black and flashes new content not very smoothly.

Ice Kindle,4,"Good Basic Kindle
","April 16, 2019","*UPDATE 6/4* So I think there was an update done shortly after I posted this comment but now batter time is similar to my original Kindle Keyboard lasting over 2 weeks. All other comments are the same.I have had this Kindle for just under a week and I've already read 4 books that's been sitting in my libray unread. I like it that its a no-fuss, no-frills device. Just read & go. I haven't had a Kindle e-reader since my 2nd Gen Kindle keyboard (I really loved that thing.) When I saw that this was $90 and had a back-light I grabbed it. So far my only complaint is that it doesn't hold charge long enough. I've charged this up several times in the week I've had it. I expected this to at least have a longer battery life than my 7th Gen Fire Tablet. Maybe it needs a software update or something.Other than that its good for people who miss reading without distractions.
"
Becca,1,"NO Text-to-Speech
","April 19, 2019","Don't be fooled with the 'accessibility'  trap.  It does not read the book to you.  It will read out loud ONE word at a time if you click on that word.  It also, causes chaos on the main menu with repeatedly reading the area you point to  then will prevent you from clicking on the area you want to navigate to, it's not very user friendly.  I did like the size of this kindle and the cover is nice as well.  But non - functional to me due to some sight issues I need it to read the book to me and it won't.  So I think i'll go for another platform all together as Amazon has chosen to stop putting text-to-speech because they have the Audible company so they can charge a monthly fee AND upcharge the books.  SIGH ! So now all my books on Amazon are useless.

Derek A. Wade,1,"Without Collections, mostly useless.
","July 6, 2019","Amazon has done a dreadful job implementing collections. Apparently the people in their eBook development lab have never actually owned books. There isn't one single avid reader alive who piles his books in a random pile, alphabetizes by title or author only, or uses date of acquisition as their category of choice-- yet those are the categorization methods you're supposed to use with this thing. Most people organize by author, then series, and then series order. THE KINDLE CAN'T EVEN DO THAT! Items within a collection are organized by author's name or title of book, NOT series order. It's like these people don't even own books!THIS IS A TENTH GENERATION EBOOK READER AND THIS PROBLEM HAS EXISTED SINCE THE FIRST GENERATION!That is not an exaggeration. My very first review of the Kindle DX in 2009 complained about the inability to easily organize books. At the time I figured it was a function of the screen and firmware, since e-ink was new technology and the Kindle itself was only a year or two old. But after ten years of the same repeated blunders, Amazon is obviously trying to pass off a BUG as a FEATURE.With the Kindle 3 (Kindle Keyboard) I was able to simply use Calibre, reboot my Kindle, and there were my 547 ebooks neatly arranged by author and series. Terry Pratchett published over seventy books in his lifetime. Piers Anthony has over thirty in the Xanth series ALONE. This is CRITICAL for anyone who reads more than one author. For crying out loud it's critical for anyone who reads more than one BOOK!I just got this thing and spent two hours using Calibre to organize my eBooks into 34 categories. According to Calibre, everything is on the Kindle right where it's supposed to be-- not one category transferred to the Kindle. Not. A. Single. One. The only categories on my Kindle are those I created on the Kindle app on my iPad-- and those only contain books I have purchased from Amazon. Apparently they altered the firmware so that the only way to add collections via third party is to jailbreak the reader, and I am not willing to do that.It's bad enough that Amazon pushed that heap of junk Fire tablet out that is the worst of both worlds: a terrible eBook reader with the same screen glare and battery life issues as the (much cheaper and more versatile) iPad, AND a terrible tablet that doesn't allow 90% of the Android Market to be installed on it including necessary apps like Dropbox and Notepad, but removing the ability of readers to organize their eBooks efficiently is unconscionable.Let me say that again, AMAZON HAD TO REMOVE THIS FEATURE! THE KINDLE 3 (KINDLE KEYBOARD) HAD IT, AND NOW THE KINDLE FIRMWARE WON'T ALLOW IT IN THE 10TH GENERATION KINDLE!It is going to take me DAYS to manually create collections and put every book in my library into them; A TASK THAT SHOULD BE AUTOMATED IN THE YEAR 2019! A task that WAS automated in 2012 when I bought my Kindle Keyboard (for forty bucks less than this one, I might add).Amazon is doing this to transparently only support collections of books THEY sell. Fine. Since the majority of my eBooks didn't come from Amazon, it sounds like it would be easier for me to find another reader and stop buying books from them at all.One star is a gift, and one you don't deserve.

Rc Repair,5,"Got here fast and works great!
","April 15, 2019","I really like my new Kindle. It works great, came fast, and the battery lets me read for a long time. I really likr the fact that its backlit. This is not my first or even 5th e-reader, but I td my first Kindle and I can see why they are so popular. Highly recommend.
"
Honest Mike,3,"Not what it should be!
","April 16, 2019","Resolution is not great, can't recommend feels a bit cheap and navigation not intuitive.Update: After using for a bit more I changed to 3 stars. The device is ok, not great and not a Paperwhite Kindle, but it works. The transitions could be better and there is a learning curve to using it. The backlight is okay not great but provides a night reading option. If they kept the PPI at 300 or so this would be a definite buy for the moment if you need one then compare with Paperwhite first.
"
Jennifer Price,5,"It’s love!
","April 16, 2019","I am very happy with this purchase.  I traded in my old kindle got a $15 credit and 25% off this one.  I love the backlight and it’s extremely easy to navigate.  My eyes don’t hurt after reading, especially after long periods.
"
Ann Niessen,4,"Page turning process inconsistant
","April 17, 2019","Thus Kindle does not have side page turning buttons.  I did not realize this.  When you tap or swipe to go forward, sometimes it goes several pages forward at one time - most disconcerting, confusing, and aggravating.  Also, frequently when you tap on the left side which should take you back one page, it goes forward. Most frustrating!  It is easy to read the print.  However,  figuring out how to save a completed book to a collection took a lot of trial and error to figure out how to accomplish.

Jan,1,"Feels super cheap and does not come pre-set and linked to your account
","May 4, 2019","Well it's a bummer. This is not Amazon experience at all. The device feels very ""plasticky"", the screen touch is super sensitive (which could be a good thing for reading, but not great for initial typing and set-up). Even despite we are replacing an existing Kindle reader on our account, it does not come pre-set. This is our 4th Kindle reading device (all different types and generations), but by far the worst experience right out of the box...UPDATE 3rd day in... It's a ""budget"" kindle. More ""budget"" than previous generations. If you are looking for a budget device this is it. I'm returning as it originally was intended to replace wife's Kindle Voyage (300ppi and beautiful backlight) that has a challenge with charging connector. It's actually surprisingly better and cheaper to re-solder the charging connector on the Voyage, than to replace it with this one...

Ken Kendall,4,"Excellent But Limited Graphics
","April 16, 2019","I purchased this because I am sometimes in locations where recharges are hard to come by.  The device certainly has much better battery life than my iPad.  This is a big plus.The screen is good for reading in any light.""Turning"" pages is a bit less than optimal.  One must touch the screen in just the right place or nothing happens.  Also, it's a bit slow.  For the first few days, I was impatient and inadvertently managed to page ahead of myself.I own the original version one Kindle reader.  It has poor quality graphics.  The latest Kindle reader suffers from the same issue.  I suppose that the fact of the matter is that better graphics come with less battery life.  Tradeoffs!My only other issue is with the Bluetooth technology.  The device absolutely won't mate with the U Connect technology in my 2018 Rubicon.  The Kindle finds the U Connect but the connection fails.  In fairness, this may be the Jeep's technology in this area (I've had two Jeep Rubicon vehicles and both didn't do well in this area.)Would I recommend this unit?  Yes, subject to the above.

texindikid,3,"Dated device feels clunky to use
","April 16, 2019","The device is just fine. It is usable and the battery life is great but I’m not a fan of the touch responsiveness. It feels like a device that could have been “all-new” 15 years ago. Selecting individual words or phrases to use dictionary/wiki Kindle features that I love to use on my older Kindle Fire feel clunky and frustrating on this device.
"
Gary Shapiro,1,"No Text to Speech
","April 20, 2019","This Kindle is beautiful for reading ebooks, but I gave it a low rating because it lists Text-to-Speech as a feature and it does not in fact have this feature. Kindles used to have this feature, but now you must have a Fire for this. The new Kindle does not have a speaker or a headphone jack. It was irritating to discover this. When I first received the device I called for tech support to find out how to turn on Text-to- Speech and was passed around to one person after another, none of whom realized that the Kindle did not and could not have this feature. If you don’t need it, then you will have no problem with this Kindle.

A. M. Hernandez,5,"I Sold My Oasis. Make Sure to Get a PopSocket!
","May 17, 2019","So I might be weird, but I bought this new Kindle and sold my Kindle Oasis. The Oasis was definitely better in terms of the screen quality and the lighting, but this new Kindle is a tad lighter and even easier to hold once I got a PopSocket for it. In terms of the screen, the quality is fine. It does look a little softer, and some smaller images can be pixelated, but overall it is fine and readable.The front lighting has a blue tint to it, the Paperwhite and Oasis are more of a white light and more even, but this is still okay. I got about 12 hours of use with the light at full blast. On level 15 it is lasting much longer but it hasn't run out yet so I don't know how much. Also, I noticed sometimes when I press the screen to turn a page it doesn't register at first, or I have to press harder. Not the end of the world. So overall I like it a lot, and for the price I can't complain (I got it on the sale).While comparing the specs it looks lower end, and it is, but when you are using it there is no problem, the text is readable. Finally, make sure to get a PopSocket PopGrip. It makes holding the Kindle with one hand so much easier and less straining. They are usually around 10 dollars and it is a huge comfort improvement. Hope you enjoy.

Fixit Jake,1,"Not worth $100!
","April 29, 2019","The technology this device uses is super old, which isn't really a bad thing since it's the correct display type to use for a dedicated reader.  HOWEVER, it does not need to be $100!  This thing should be selling for half that, or even less.  Overall it is sluggish and slow.  Interacting with the store is frustrating, and entering text reminds me of phones a decade ago.  Again, I get that this is dedicated to a single task and it does that well, it's just the price tag for such old hardware that really gets me...

D. Christensen,3,"Didn't do enough research
","April 18, 2019","I didn't need a new Kindle, my old one is just fine.  What I wanted was a Kindle that allowed me to read and listen at the same time.  This isn't possible with this model.  I had long chats with techs at Amazon and finally found out from someone in the audio tech division that I could not get a lended audio book from my library.  I was able to return the Kindle without a problem, along with the accessories I bought.  I asked the community for help and received some valuable information, but not enough for me to want to pursue keeping this model.  I prefer to get all my ebooks from my library via Overdrive, this works really well for me and it is free.

I love my Kindle,3,"I love my new Kindle ... not so much.
","April 22, 2019","I bought this because my 2 old kindles were running out of battery.  This one seemed nice with the back light, which is the reason I'm keeping it.  However, the touch screen is too sensitive and jumps pages at a time but I'm not quite sure how.  The old kindles had the buttons on the sides which I much prefer.  With the old Kindles I could archive books that I'd finished and not take up storage space.  With this Kindle it either shows ALL or DOWNLOADED.  I guess you could set up a collection of books you've added but not yet read but that seems like a lot of work.  I like the back light and the extra storage but there seem to be more things that I don't like because they just seem harder to use.  For me, the touch screen isn't much of a plus, I prefer the buttons on the side.  It seems a little more slippery to hold on to also.Update to my original review. I like this even less than I did when I received it. When I hold it in one hand and try to turn the page, if I've got any pressure on the case at all where it might be trying to flex a little, the page doesn't turn so you have to change how you hold it to turn the page. It's still skipping pages for no apparent reason and every once in awhile while I'm trying to turn the page, it highlights something or brings up the dictionary. AKK!I'm not complaining about the ads because I knew that when I bought it and I don't mind that. I'm keeping it because of the back light, I found that I do enjoy that. However, I'm absolutely going to replace the battery in at least one of my old kindles with the page turning buttons because I miss that when I read in daylight or good light.

Amazon Customer,1,"Dead pixel
","April 15, 2019","I’m one of those who ordered the device prior to release date and was very happy about this product, but as soon as i opened and turned it on I found a dead pixel on the display, this is kinda disappointing however i really don’t care about one dead pixel but it doesn’t mean it’s acceptable. I’m already considering returning it!Update: Returned the first one and requested a replacement, as you can see in the attached photo I haven’t even set it up and there is a dead pixel on the screen already :oUpdate2: I ended up returning my second one and just decided to go with the paperweight and I’m glad that i did. Such big difference in quality and workability!

Pamela J. Peerce Landers,3,"Love the Backlight Feature. Hate this Touch Screen.
","May 17, 2019","I got this to replace an old Kindle reader I had. I bought it because it is backlit when the ambient light isn’t sufficient to allow you to read easily. And, I really love this feature! It makes it possible to read in bed without having my side table light on and it also makes it possible to read in the car at night.The battery life is good. Similar to my old one which I charged about every 2-4 weeks.Three things are annoying and are the reason I knocked off 2 stars:1. The narrow spacing makes it very difficult to swipe to the next page in your library. Most of the time, I inadvertently hit a book and open it. The alternative is to type in the page number you want to go to. Works but takes more time. In my opinion, Amazon should reduce the size of the icons or shift them to the left to make it possible to swipe between pages easily.2. Advancing the page or going back is hit or miss. More than half the time, I have to tap the side of the page several times to get it to advance. On rare occasions, I have to close my Kindle and try again.3. Finally, 3 times in the last two days, the page advance mechanism got stuck/confused. Tapping on the left should go back, but instead went forward. Then, it did nothing and I had to shut my Kindle down and restart it.I have had it for about 2 weeks now. Really hoping that Amazon issues a software update to fix the swiping and page turning problems.But, in my opinion the best fix for the page turning problems is to go back to the buttons on the side. They always worked perfectly.

Frederick Nunes,5,"What A Deal
","May 13, 2019","I have owned several kindles.  Too many.  Luckily, these have come to a price point where its actually worth it to have a spare.  I own two models at this time.  The latest Paperwhite and now this one.  When I saw this on sale for $69.99, I could not resist.Now, lets talk about the 167PPI display versus the 300PPI screen of the Paperwhite.  I honestly do not see the difference that I was expecting.  It may be different on the Oasis, I would not know.  But on this basic Kindle, text is sharp and the touchscreen matches that of my Paperwhite.  Additionally, I like the textured back of this white Kindle versus the rubberized feel of the paperwhite.  That tends to draw the oil from your skin of you hold the device in Hand while using.  The textured backing does not do this.  I find this $69.99 Kindle to be perfect in size, weight, and feel in hand.  I actually have a feeling that I will be using this basic model more than my Paperwhite.  I am very pleased, and even at $89.99 - this is a great deal.  Do not get put off by the ""Special Offers"" either.  They do not interfere with your reading.  What I find shameful is that with the ""Special Offers"" removed, you will see the same screensavers that they have used now for YEARS.  At least with the Special Offers, you get a bit of variety.  Amazon, come on - give people the option of using the book cover of the novel you are reading as its screensaver, or perhaps an option to use your own.  These dated screensavers need to go.  Seriously.  Overall - this is a brilliant reader at a VERY cheap price.  Good luck.

Amazon Customer,5,"Great product!
","April 17, 2019","I ordered this item for my 13-year-old daughter who is an avid reader and book lover. Finding books she wants takes up so much time and too much space in her room. The issue was she LOVES the feel of books and said that the light from my Kindle Fire made her eyes feel awful. I was hesitant to try to it out for these reasons but ordered it anyway with plans to resell it if she truly didn't like it. So far we absolutely love it!! Definitely easier on the eyes than the harsh Kindle Fire! To give it the authentic book feel I ordered the charcoal fabric cover which is beautiful. Before I snapped it into the cover I felt it was awkward to hold. Not because it was too big/heavy or too small/light but because it was more in between all of those. It almost felt like it could use a pop socket until I put the cover on. The cover gives it an even better feel so I would strongly suggest ordering one along with this Kindle. This product was very easy to set up and to navigate. Purchasing books is a breeze. Books download quickly and pages turn quickly. Absolutely love the size. We travel a lot and it is so nice to not have to take bulky books in the backpack on flights. Very happy with this purchase.

Justin Thomas,1,"The OBJECTIVE TRUTH about this Kindle
","September 9, 2019","I've now copied and pasted this review because ironically Amazon doesn't seem to like it.. now I'll just keep posting it, so you might as well leave it alone... as I titled this, an OBJECTIVE critique... addressing this thing on numerous points. I'd suggest anyone new to e-readers/kindles read it thoroughly...Overall Size - Ironically enough, though small for MY hands, the size is good and would make for easy travel if I hadn't returned it.Build Quality - Absolutely terrible... just holding this thing felt like if I squeezed it too hard it would break.The ""New Front Light"" - This is a complete misnomer and poor design. I've actually seen reviews claiming theres had no front light. That is because NONE of them do. This is much more of a BACK LIGHT... but Amazon isn't going to use the same terminology used on the more expensive Paperwhite or Oasis. Bad design because if you have it cranked it's a battery killer.Screen - Low PPI.. and warning to ALL OF YOU who have never owned anything with an e-ink screen: Do NOT expect this to look or behave anything like a typical phone or tablet. E-ink works completely different, and results in horrible quality with sluggish reaction, and constant black flashes to avoid ghosting on the screen.. yes it is as obnoxious as it sounds.Battery Life - Good, BUT only if you have the front light disabled/turned way down.. and you're not speed reading. The biggest battery drain on e-readers with these screens is the process of changing each page. So the more pages, the quicker the drain.4gb Storage - ""Thousands of titles""...? This MIGHT apply if you purchase ALL of your books through Amazon directly in their proprietary format. As soon as you start converting your own EPUB files over, that space dwindles FAST.. None of my ebooks were purchased from Amazon and I couldn't even fit 200 titles...So why are these so popular? For the same reason Apple is still in business. The majority of people don't mind paying MORE money for LESS customization in the name of Convenience.Do yourself a favor, spend $10 less on the Fire HD 8 and use it as a reader.. You'll spend less, and have infinite more possibilities..Reading in daylight? I have an anti-glare screen guard on mine that has NEVER lost a battle with the sun on mine, and the rest of the time its a nice, vibrant, colorful screen with a good reaction time (compared to the kindle anyway).4x the amount of storage WITH a micro SD card slot.I have HUNDREDS of my books loaded in EPUB format along with a ton of full color comics & graphic novels. None of which did I have to convert.Did I mention the AppStore? You'll also have DIRECT access to additional book suppliers like Overdrive.. not to mention music, movies, etc..Battery life? This thing gives me a solid 8-9 hours of reading time. Does that compare to the typical Kindle? No. But let's be honest here... if you read 9 hours straight, its probably a good idea to take a break anyway! Yes it means charging more often... Do ANY of you go DAYS without charging SOME kind of device you own? Phone? Smart Watch?Let's be real.. looking at all of these things... is it ACTUALLY worth MORE money for the 1-2 advantages this thing MIGHT have over the Fire Tab?  No.The only reason to get a Kindle is if you're not tech savvy enough to know you should buy your books elsewhere and load them onto the Fire Tab manually via USB... If you're just fine reading the selection that comes with their paid monthly service (not worth it... just look up Overdrive and several other services) OR you don't mind buying all of your books from Amazon because ""its easy"" ... THEN.. this Kindle is for you..To anyone who IS tech savvy enough to do these things manually, or wants more bang for your buck, or find e-ink screens beyond obnoxious... go with the Fire Tab.(Note: I do NOT recommend getting a fire tab in place of a proper higher end tablet... it simply doesn't have the OOMPH. But for reading and basic needs? Works a charm.. and Amazon I'm not joking, I will keep posting this. You do NOT have the right to remove a review just because YOU don't like what it has to say...

Courtney Zeigler,4,"A great little E-reader for the price
","June 13, 2019","I’m a longtime user of the Kindle Keyboard.  As someone with not-so-great vision, reading on tablets puts a lot of strain on my eyes.  The Keyboard has been perfect for me.  Easy on the eyes.  Long battery life.  But the lack of lighting makes it difficult to use in bed.  I’ve bought booklights to clip on it, but they would often slip off or the battery life was too short.  I even bought a booklight to clip onto the headboard of my bed, but the lighting was a bit much.  After years of using my Keyboard, I thought it was time to try a new e-reader.  Buy something with a built-in light.  After some research, I decided on the All-new-Kindle.  Not only because it had a front light, but because it happened to be on sale.  I always appreciate a good deal.My initial thoughts upon opening the box were mixed.  It looked sleek, much sturdier than my Keyboard (which cracked not long after I purchased it), but was much smaller than I anticipated.  That’s not a problem, just unexpected.  Setup was easy.  I managed to get into my account and began downloading books from my library.  But I was already noticing one problem.  I had only downloaded a handful of books and noticed the battery power had dropped by about 5%.  Oof, not a great start.  I started to look through the settings to see if I could help prolong the battery life, as I’ve done on my tablets.  But then I hit a snag.  The screen went berserk.  And then it froze.Well, that’s not a good start.I held the button down to restart it, wondering if I’d just made a $69.99 mistake.  I’ve had this happen before with tablets.  The problems worked themselves out after a good reset.  Hopefully, this would too.  Thankfully, it did.  After that initial restart, I didn’t run into another hiccup.  The battery life was still going down faster than I’d like, so I made a few changes.  I only used the front light when in a poorly lit room.  Once I’ve downloaded any books I’ve purchased or borrowed, I set the Kindle to airplane mode.  And the most important thing of all—I do NOT let the Kindle go to sleep mode if I can help it.  Instead, I choose to turn the screen off.  I’ve noticed a considerable difference in battery life by turning off the screen.  Yes, it takes an extra few moments of pressing the button to select this option, but I’d rather spend those extra few seconds extending my battery life, than having to continually charge my Kindle.These little changes have made a considerable difference in prolonging my Kindle use.  I can turn the screen off in the morning and come back to it later that night, to find that the battery power has only gone down by one or two percent.  I was curious to see how my Kindle’s battery would hold up against a 484-page book.  I started with the device fully charged.  I read the book over a two-day span.  By the last page, my battery power was at 93%.  This is not with continuous use of the front light (again, I only used it if necessary).  The results are still better than I expected.  While I still love my Keyboard for its long life, these little tweaks have at least made the All-new Kindle a decent replacement.Pulling up the menu bar can sometimes be a tedious task.  Sometimes the Kindle will respond by flipping to the next page (or several pages) or not register my command at all.  This also happens when trying to turn pages.  Sometimes I find more than one icon for a book on my home screen.  Sometimes I have to remove them. Sometimes they remove themselves.  So far, these are the only other problems I’ve discovered since purchasing this device.Is it perfect?  Definitely not.Is it affordable?  Definitely.Is it worth it?  I think so.I’ve had plenty of devices that started out with little hiccups.  Battery life is always one of my concerns when buying a new device.  The battery life is not the best, but it’s also not the worst.  After a few tweaks, you can improve your Kindle’s battery life.

A. Morgan,1,"Only Holds a charge for 24 hours
","June 18, 2019","Of all the Kindles I have owned (8 so far I think) this is the worst. It does not hold a charge - I will read for an hour - put in on standby and then come back after 6 hours and the whole charge has emptied. Disappointing and really a waste of money.UPDATE: July 2019Amazon reached out to me and did some troubleshooting for the Kindle and the battery life seemed to be fixed - for a few weeks - and then it did the same thing - hold a charge for about 2 hours and would go from 100% to 17% in 2 hours.I am going to abandon the kindle -e-reader. I will use my ipad for reading my current kindle books - but I am now going to explore Nook.

DonkeyBelly,3,"Not quite there
","April 19, 2019","At the heart of it, the Kindle White reader and back light work perfectly. So, 5/5 stars for that.Bad stuff: my personal library of books is shown to me 6 at a time, instead of a tidy list (and I don't have the option to change it to anything more elegant), and it becomes cumbersome trying to sift through all of my titles.My home menu is instead gunked up with suggestions of books and Kindle Unlimited and Prime offers. I get that you're trying to push more products on me, but don't bog my home menu up to this extent, please.I don't love that since I switched from my First Gen Kindle that My Highlights didn't transfer over.I can't make the text as small as I'd like, to be able to fit more words on a page, but I feel like I'm getting used to that already.Ultimately, the device works very well as an e-reader, but I wish my home menu was less clunky. Tidying up my list of books that are actually on my device would go a long way, especially if Downloaded books could be changed to default. As it is right now, my list of books even includes titles I've borrowed from the Overdrive app, and can't even read if I wanted to.

SBP,5,"Glow baby glow
","May 17, 2019","I refused to upgrade from my Kindle 4 because it still worked, and I don't like waste. But after a long series of frustrations with external book lights, and the acknowledgement that paying less than $100 (after discount and trade-in for the old Kindle) for something that I truly love and do for hours each week, if not each day (reading) is a worthwhile expenditure of money, I caved and bought this one.She's so light. She lights up. You can adjust the light. It's so nice.I put a screen film on her but I didn't buy a case. I put a Pop Socket on the back which helps me hold her nicely. I haven't quite figured out all the controls - sometimes I touch a region of the screen and the light controls come up, and I can't figure out how or why or replicate it, and today I kept pressing the nonexistent buttons on the side to turn the page even though I have had it for a few weeks now, or quite often I try swiping it up as if it were an iPhone - but I probably should just look the controls up and figure it out.I think the home screen is a little weird - it's divided into sections, like your library, recommended for you, etc. - it feels like Netflix. I'd prefer to just see my library. My old Kindle just listed what books were on the device, it was simple. But this is a quibble.Overall I'm so happy I bought this!

I think Amazon is over pricing some items. The device itself works well, is responsive. It is still a black and white display, fine for books and nothing else. The Kindle can deliver books too, in sepia if you desire. I love Amazon and the Fire, but money is hard to come by if you are retired.

That was over the return and refund time limit, but Amazon offered to replace it.  Sooo...I'm tickled silly with this one.  I can read for about 24 hours between charges (probably could last much longer if I didn't use the light) and it charges really fast.  The menu system is a little slow, but I can live with that on a reader.  I've had this one about a month and it's exhibited none of the symptoms of the first one so I'm pretty sure it's a keeper.This is not for web browsing or multimedia.  It's perfect for reading.  It's incredibly light and with its built in light I can read anywhere.  Like I said, I'm tickled silly with this one.

","May 13, 2019","I have an old keyboard kindle which I like a lot.  The case is cracked and it seemed time for a new one.  This kindle is similar to the old one in that it has few bells and whistles.  I like the size and even discovered I like the front lit screen.  I wish it were possible to move the page forward from either side of the screen or to be able to set it so the page advances from the left hand side.  I've gotten used to the touch screen and only occasionally have problems with it advancing more than one page at a time.  The light, however, drains the battery.  My old kindle could go weeks - even a month - without needing a charge.  This kindle requires charging at least once a week and I only read before bed.  I find this very inconvenient.

Mike C.,3,"It's OK, but...
","April 27, 2019","This is my third kindle.  I don't need a lot of whistles and bells om the higher priced units, just something to read.  I still use my 2nd kindle, but the connection to charge is breaking and so I got this new one.  I like some of the new changes, easy to go from WiFi to airplane mode and back, the new page set up with new fonts, etc.But then the petty annoyances.  I got this with a preorder so guess it was one of the first made.  It doesn't always want to advance to the next page, you can rub, you can tap, I think you can hit it with a hammer, but nothing happens.  After awhile it will respond. A window opens and increases the size of the font and then closes.  The process I found was to leave the page, open the window to do fonts, etc and change the font back to the desired size, close the window and reopen your book.  This is a random action, you can read a dozen pages, turning as you go and then every other page it either fails to advance or it changes the font.  I am thinking it might be needing to breakin, but if not I will return for a fix or replace.  This unit has the potential be simply a really good e reader.  I don't do audio books, nor surf the web or all the other things they want to install in these e readers.  I do find the charging dock to be a weak point as my first reader broke at the connection and my second is breaking there.  maybe they canfiguare a charging system that is done with WiFi or something without plug in a cable.

I can travel with it, or leisurely read it at home or anywhere. It all not too heavy. You can turn the back light up bright or essentially have it almost off completely which I love. I can’t handle the glare of backlights.The only con I would have are I miss the forward and back buttons on the kindle keyboard 3G. It was convenient if you were reading left handed.

DavidsList,5,"The question is: why wouldn't you buy Kindle?
","July 27, 2019"," For this year's Prime Day, I purchased the All-new Kindle for my wife.It was just the perfect time to purchase the Kindle for her because she recently started reading the Alexander Hamilton by Ron Chernow. I felt bad for her that the book was so bulky and heavy but more importantly she constantly had to pause from reading to look up words in dictionary with her iPhone.We already have 8th generation Kindle and Paperwhite models for our children so I told her to try reading on it.Well, she loved reading on the Kindle because it solved both of her pain points (weight and dictionary), making it more pleasent to read.My wife and the kids ended up fighting for the Kindle to read their own book so it was a no-brainer to purchase a Kindle for my wife during the Prime Day.When comparing this All-new Kindle with the previous model of Kindle that my son has:[+] This new model has a built-in front light but previous model doesn't.  The light doesn't strain your eyes like the back-lid lights found other devices such as iPad.[+] this new model is slightly thinner and flatEverything else is pretty much the same.If you don't have Kindle, let me summarize why it's a must-have for book lovers (or watch my video):✔️ You can read on Kindle for up to a month without charging.✔️ There's no glare on the screen, even on bright sunny day outside.✔️ It has a front-light rather than a back-light so there's no eye strain.✔️ It's super light weighted.✔️ The device doesn't get hot in your hands.✔️ You can look up words instantly by clicking on the word you don't know while reading.✔️ Vocabulary Builder - it remembers all the words you looked up and shows you the actual text from the book the word was looked up!If you love to read books, I highly recommend Kindle. You will not regret it.If you are willing to spend a little more, you can get Kindle Paperwhite, which has better resoultion, bigger storage, and is waterproof! I'm already thinking about upgrading my wife's kindle to Paperwhite so she can read it during a bubble bath or inside a pool.THE BOTTOM LINE:10 out of 5 stars.  Highly recommended.You can now borrow e-books from your library and read it on Kindle!I hope this helps and if it did, please click on the helpful button below!

krf,4,"Great Kindle but ...
","April 17, 2019","This is my fifth Kindle, and always like the paper-light the best for pure reading.  However, I am finding the page slow to change, and many times I have to try several places before page will turn.  I'm wondering if the magnetic cover might be causing the slowness?  Kindle is lightest yet!

jediandrew97,5,"Like the White Color. Works well great value!
","May 10, 2019","Got this about two days ago and I got to say having owned a 2nd gen paperwhite before this isn’t that much different slightly lower res screen but it really doesn’t look that bad at all even compared to the newer kindles text still looks pretty sharp and the backlight makes this a great value. If you can get this on sale like I did it’s an even better value than the paperwhite and is even a bit smaller but with the same screen size of 6 inches as usual, backlight is as said nice to have and gets very bright with no issues, one thing to take note of is I had one glitch with the touchscreen and that it glitches out for a second but since then it’s worked quite well and has been pretty responsive so far swiping and tapping on things and for reading. For those of you who read a lot of comics you may want to get the paperwhite or oasis but it would still be manageable to do so. It’s also important to keep in mind that there’s is only 4GB of storage with around 2.5 usable but for most this shouldn’t be an issue and you should be able to hold 100’s of books maybe more, the potential problem is you might only be able to store a handful of audio books but I haven’t used any that I have on this kindle yet.So for those of you out their interested at a new kindle check this one out first even if you are upgrading from a 2nd gen paperwhite like I did all the extra tweaks make this very compelling especially if you can find this even cheaper.

Christy,4,"Unsubscribe From Special Offers is an Option
","April 28, 2019","I’ve enjoyed my Kindle but found the special offers annoying and I’ve noticed others complaining too. You get the choice of buying it with or without. I chose with special offers because it was cheaper. Once I realized it annoyed me, I unsubscribed. You go to Accounts, Content and Devices, and Devices. Then Unsubcribe.  If you are someone who has found it annoying you can do this too.— However, they do charge you even though it doesn’t tell you that you are being charged. I got an email with the charge of $22.80. I called Customer Service to get the charge removed since I was unaware I was being charged. So just be aware that you will be charged to remove the Special Offers. The customer service rep was very helpful.

Insightful shopper,1,"Feels like dated technology
","July 15, 2019","I bought this to read more ebooks but frankly, was quickly disappointed. I will give the pros and then the cons.Pros: the size and weight are fantastic. Very portable, light weight and fits even in small purses. Battery life is great too.Cons: it feels like you are handling a really dated device: the resolution is very poor (you can see the pixels in the letters), everything is black and white (no colors), which to be fair, is specified in the description, but nonetheless feels extremely weird. If you are in a job/occupation where reading graphs and charts (and therefore colors) is important, this is not your tool. Finally, the touchscreen is very dull. I had a hard time trying to make it work.In sum, I wasn’t pleased. I am used to reading on my iphone, so reading from this Kindle felt like going backwards technology-wise. I suspect this is a great tool for older people who want to read a novel in their free time, or by the beach, but most younger people used to read in higher resolution interfaces will have a hard time adjusting to it. I ended up returning it.

JMKTech,3,"Fine, but you'll want an upgrade before long.
","May 9, 2019","I've had a few Kindle devices in my time, a 4th gen standard, Voyage, Paperwhite 3, and an Oasis. I'll be returning this model in favor of a Paperwhite 4.For the price this is a fairly decent little device given the now-included backlight, though it seemed relatively uneven compared to more premium models.  I actually prefer the raised bezels to the entirely flat Voyage/PW4, it provides a tactile distinction so you don't accidentally change pages while holding the device.  It also holds up better without a case as you can place the device face down without worrying about scratches.The thing is if you're a dedicated reader, this will likely be more of a stopgap solution than a one-time purchase and that's because of the 167 ppi resolution.  Text looks fine if a little pixelated but it's certainly useable. The real issue is that this particular limitation causes less words to appear on the screen at identical settings to the other 6"" Kindle devices - there seems to be additional spacing between letters to accommodate the lower resolution to the point where you lose about 20% of the content per page.  It might not seem like much on the surface but a few books in you'll notice how much additional interaction you're having with the device instead of focusing on the content.The Paperwhite 4 is only $30 more, and while I understand that every dollar counts a Kindle is something that you realistically don't need to replace very often - you'll easily squeeze half a decade out of your purchase as long as you take care of it.  Settling for this model is nice for the savings now but I think you'll be itching for an upgrade in a few months or so if you really get into using an e-reader.  With a Paperwhite I don't think you will have to consider another purchase for some time so I'd advise spending the extra money.The lowest tier model will always have some features held back for the sake of justifying the more expensive purchases, but for the next update of the basic Kindle I'd like to see Amazon use the display resolution of the original Paperwhite model - 212 ppi, in between this model and the PW4. It would be the go-to recommendation for anyone who doesn't need waterproofing or the sleeker design of the step up model.  Until then this is a great buy if you just want something to take with you on a plane once in a blue moon but not as an everyday companion.One last note, even after all of these years Kindles are still shipped out with a surprising number of quality control issues.  One dead pixel on this device and I had similar issues on both my Voyage and Oasis as well requiring an exchange.  Be sure to double check you've got a good one before your return period expires, it doesn't matter how much you're spending on a Kindle, they all have issues.

Andrew C.,2,"A lot of glitches
","April 27, 2019","The touch screen is way too sensitive, and there is no way to adjust it. You don’t even need to physically touch the screen, if you just hover your finger a millimeter or so away from the screen, it will turn the page. Very frustrating. It will also highlight notes for you when you don’t mean to (because your finger was again hovering too close to the screen for too long), and you cannot delete select notes...you have to delete the entire note clippings document. Also very annoying.There are also many glitches. It freezes often, and since there is only one button, it is very frustrating trying to figure out what to do. Then sometimes it will just suddenly restart on its own. Sometimes I’ll open my book, and it will be several chapters behind where I left off.

Why was this not done before shipping????  I tried to download by cloud library, but only two-thirds of my books downloaded, and took forever.  Slow, sluggish to respond, a WASTE of money.  ADVICE:  GO TO BARNES AND NOBLE AND BUY A NOOK.ADDENDUM:  After three months, the battery will not hold a charge for more than 2-3 days - and that is with minimal to NO use!!!!  This purchase was a mistake, and I should have returned it as defective when I had the chance.  BUYER, BEWARE!!!!!!!!!

I was so excited when this new one had text to speech so that I could listen to my books while driving.  The first one I got wouldn't connect to any bluetooth device so they sent me a replacement this one will connect but will not connect consistently to a blue tooth device. As you can see in the video it will not respond to touch 80% of the time. Not even to turn the page.

Costello,1,"Read Description Carefully Before Buying
","November 26, 2019","Going to try this again, since Amazon refused to post my first review. There are two major problems with this Kindle. First, the swipe function that allows you to turn pages--basically the single most important function of the device--works when it feels like it, and it feels like it about 80% of the time. It's incredibly annoying. Overall it feels like a much cheaper, less responsive, low quality version of the Paperwhite I bought this to replace. Secondly, there are annoying banner ads when you open it, and every time you access the library. Want to get rid of them? Pay Amazon more money. I admit this is in part my fault for not more carefully reading the product description, but it's just a really annoying practice. I expect that kind of thing on a free to play mobile game or app, not from a company like Amazon on one of its flagship products. If my old Kindle were functional at all, I would return this thing. Sadly, it's not.  If you have an older version that still works, keep using it until it literally explodes rather than buying one of these.

Wee-G,5,"My Kindle Review
","April 27, 2019","I got my Kindle through a Trade In discount for my previous Paperwhite. and two gift cards for my birthday.  I was intrigued by the audible feature, but you could only fit 20 audible books, and you can't read and listen at the same time like in the Kindle app though.  I bought with special offers edition, thinking if I don't want the special offers at a later time, I could easily unsubscribe,  I saw when I went to register my device, I saw that you could of unsubscribe for free, so I contacted customer service, and they took off the ads for free which was a bonus!!

green jay,4,"Amazon's Greed Ruins Everything UPDATE: Not a phone but better than a bunch of hardcover books.
","October 9, 2019","Just received my new Kindle. Charged it and turned it on to find a special offers screen, as expected. No problem there. After setting up the device, I went to my library. There, occupying a strip at the bottom of the page, was the special offer that appeared when I first turned it on. No matter what I tried I could not get rid of it except by spending an extra $20. What a rip off. It resembles extortion. Amazon has brought many good things to the world, all of it financed by selling stuff and attracting customers with excellent service, but this is shameless greed run amuck. Shame on you Amazon. This really devalues the Kindle, a device made for people who want to read without killing trees. Reading is a solo experience. Readers do not expect to have their reading disrupted on every page.UPDATE: I bit the bullet and spent the extra money to get rid of the ads, and have been using my new Kindle since then.  It is a vast improvement over the one I traded in and the rebate and discount for the trade-in justified the expense. The new Kindle performs as advertised. The screen is illuminated in any light, including no light. Amazon has reconfigured the ratio of height to width to make it more compact than the one I traded in. The area of the screen appears to be the same and it fits my hand perfectly. It is much lighter than a phone or tablet even though the battery really does hold a charge for weeks. For $10 I bought a MoKo case that fits perfectly and automatically turns the Kindle off when you close it and on when you open it. All together then, the size, weight, and automatic on and off case make it as close as one can get to reading an actual book. In one sense it is better than an actual book. Expensive surgery has corrected my vision to 20-20, but I still need glasses to read some books in some lights because glare slightly blurs the print. This is not a problem with the new Kindle. The adjustable screen light eliminates glare.Before you purchase one, and you should if you like to read, remember that it is designed for reading books and documents and really not much else. It is not a tablet or a phone. The screen does not display colors. The browser is probably inadequate, although I have not tried it and do not intend to. The wifi function downloads books fast and that is about all I would use it for. To check email I use my phone. For reference I use my computer. Over half a century I have purchased dozens of books whose cost, especially when updated to today's prices and even considering that I have typically purchased remainders or from local book sales, was more than the cost of this device. When the book cases at home filled up, I have had to part with books by donating them to local book sales and lost them forever, unless I bought them back at a subsequent sale. Now I can keep the books I may want to consult again.One major drawback is the lack of an audio port. Given how much Amazon promotes Audible, which is over priced in my view, it is surprising that they provide no convenient way to listen to my library of audible books. Nope, if you want to listen to books, you'll have to struggle to make a blue tooth link to something with audio output or fork over $50 or more to Amazon for a decent pair of blue tooth ear phones.  There's that Greed factor again.

JCW,4,"Comparison with newest Paper White and old Kindle Keyboard
","September 14, 2019","There is nothing unexpected about this Kindle...it is exactly as described.  I will compare this to my old Kindle Keyboard (3) and also to my husband's Kindle - the newest Paper White.My husband got the Paper White first, and I got to try it out.  I chose this All-New Kindle 2019 because I didn't like the all-glass front on the Paper White.  I like to be able to feel exactly where the border ends and the screen begins so I don't accidentally touch the screen and turn the page or something else.The resolution is not as sharp as the Paper White, but it is good enough for me.  It is about like my old Kindle Keyboard, maybe even a little better, and the resolution on that was always fine.  I don't read graphic novels, however, so if you do, you probably would want a higher resolution.  But for ordinary reading it is completely legible.  I picked an easy-to-read font and have had zero problems.This Kindle also has what they call a ""built-in front light.""  Basically, the screen just lights up.  It is only slightly different than the Paper White, not any significant difference.  You just adjust the brightness in the settings.  The darkest (with the light completely ""off"" I guess) is really too dark even in good light...it is darker even than my old Kindle with no light.  But it is completely adjustable and you can set it for whatever is most comfortable for you.  It is a great feature, and I do love not having to have a book light to read in bed anymore!This Kindle is also not water proof like the Paper White.  But I never, in 8+ years with my old Kindle, dropped it in water.  (I had to replace it because my cat knocked it off and it popped open and would no longer work...otherwise I would still be using it).  But if you like to read in the pool or bathtub a lot, the Paper White would likely be a better choice.I almost paid a bit more for the version Without Special Offers (ads) because I really loved all the beautiful screen saver images on my old Kindle (art work, famous authors, etc.).  Before I ordered I found out that, unfortunately, the new Kindle does not have all those lovely screen savers.  Apparently they have switched to just different pictures of typewriter keyboards and typesetting letters.  Interesting, but not nearly as pretty or inspiring as the old screen saver.  So I just got the one with the ads and I just ignore them.The main negative this has as compared to the old Kindles is that it is solely touch screen.  For the most part, this is nice, but I really sorely miss the side buttons to turn the page.  I kind of hate having to touch the screen every time I want to turn the page (though I am getting used to it).  I used to just rest my thumb on the button and it was so natural and easy.  I have no idea why they got rid of the page-turn buttons but it was a mistake.  Cheaper to make, I would guess.Overall, I am very happy so far with this Kindle.  I miss the lovely screen saver and the page-turn buttons, but I like the touch screen for every thing else, and I love the light.

New York customer,4,"better in some ways,worse in other ways to prior kindle
","April 18, 2019","More features and versatility compared to my older kindle reader and that is the reason for 4 stars. The backlight is appreciated since I read in bed at night.  But I find this not easy to hold for reading in bed as there is little room to hold it around the edges without touching the screen and causing an unintended page turn. Ironic since, my other criticism is that the page doesn't always turn when I touch the screen. Requires just the right pressure and I suppose I will learn this over time. But it is the reason I hate touch screens in general. However, this one is not worse than any other I've used.

Amazon Customer,4,"Not the best value, but it'll work
","June 8, 2019","I haven't had a kindle since they first came out. I love being able to read without my phone. The built in light is great. I had no problem connecting to wifi or my account. Battery life is great. I wish it was a little larger. I am also struggling with the blurriness, after reading on my phone for years. It seems that for over a hundred dollars, it would be a little larger and crisper screen. It also annoys me that I had to pay extra to not have advertisements, that's ridiculous to me.

mclicious,3,"Why does everyone hate buttons so much?
","August 9, 2019","I'm coming to this from a Kindle Keyboard that I bought in 2011, just a day before they announced the Fire (which sucks, money-wise; I definitely got cheated on a better price because they immediately discounted my Kindle that next day), and the only reason I bought it is because after eight years of faithful service, it slid off my lap and froze, and no matter how many times I tried to reset it, it never worked again. So here I am with this one, and I hate it. I'm not saying that just because I don't like change, but because WHY IS EVERYONE SO AGAINST BUTTONS? The touch screen means I'm accidentally flipping like 2358790 pages every time my knuckle accidentally brushes the screen, and it doesn't really respond to swipes, just pushes. It's awful. The homepage is also terrible; even though my books were meticulously organized into categories on my old Kindle and they synced over to this one, you can't seem to default to a homepage view with just your collections; you have to see every single file you've ever added to your Kindle, and then if you go to collections, you have no way of knowing if all those files are in the collection or not--you have to go back to that messy homepage view and ""add to collection"" and just see if that one happens to be checked off or not. On my old Kindle, my homepage was all the collections followed by loose files, so I could easily transfer them into a collection and have my homepage instantly tidied up and know where everything was.I might still be sending this back. It's awful. What a mess. I hate that my hand can't relax, lest I skip a page when I don't mean to, which means I'm tense the entire time I'm reading a book, WHICH IS SUPPOSED TO BE A PLEASURABLE ACTIVITY. And I don't see what's useful about a device that can hold eleventybillion files on it if they don't have it set up to allow you to stay organized.

omg,3,"Battery issues
","April 17, 2019","Will update if the replacement works better.UPDATE: Battery life is so much better. First one was definitely glitchy.  The trick in having a  great battery life despite reading for a few hours a day is no special offers, power saving enabled and airplane mode at all times unless downloading.  I've had mine for a week and it's at 62%.First impressions-I got the white one so I can find it better. lol (last ereader was black)  I loved the thinness of it, the tiny size and just the overall matte feel to it.  Despite being used to the Paperwhite's higher dpi, it really didn't bother me at all with this being a lower one.  I was really pleased with it and got busy reading.  I typically read for a few hours a day with zero or very little light. (at most 7ish at night)  I don't use Bluetooth and I only download the book that I am actually reading. (earlier tip that the more books stored, the slower the kidnle is and more battery it drains)  I also put it on airplane mode (another tip) so the wifi does not drain the battery.  I had the power savings enabled from the settings as well.So imagine my surprise that the battery was at 40ish percent by the 2nd day of having it after it being fully charged to begin with.  I contacted Amazon and was told at first that the battery lasts for 30 minutes a day for 4 weeks at 10 light.  Well, that's not good!  I read a lot more than 30 minutes.  But while in sleep mode it dropped another 20%.  I then got offered a replacement.I just got the replacement today.  I also got it without special offers to see if it helps.  I hope the first one was just glitchy.  I will update after a few days to see if this one also proves glitchy.  I hope not though, this is a really nice kindle!

RN1,5,"Basic Kindle Review and a few comparisons to the Paperwhite
","June 27, 2019","The Kindle was a gift...and I'm known for returning most gifts because often, they aren't just quite what I wanted.  Which takes us to the basic Kindle....I'm a book person, so I was pretty sure that the Kindle, no matter how good, was going back.Well, to my surprise, I've really enjoyed the thing...here are a few observations:1.  If you've never had a tablet, then it may take a while to figure some things out as to the features and operation...no more included manuals and Amazon/Kindle isn't all that clear on their included website link about everything you might need to know...fortunately, you can google all your questions and find answers pretty easily.2.  The light is not as bright as the paperwhite...but its totally ""ok"" for both indoor, outdoor and evening use.  I would also add that the paperwhite screen seems to be a bit ""whiter"" but this is a non issue when it comes to actual reading.3.  The paperwhite starts up a little faster....but after that, they are pretty similar...and actually, I prefer the touch sensitivity on the basic Kindle to the paperwhite...but that is just me.4.  The device is super light weight, which is nice5.  Its easy to toggle between books.Overall, the basic Kindle is a great products and you should not feel that you are giving something up by not getting a paperwhite....the basic Kindle will hold thousands of books and operates flawlessly.  From my perspective, for anyone considering a ""reader"" the basic Kindle will provide a very good experience....recommended

WendyZski,2,"Newer not necessarily better
","October 21, 2019","I had been replacing Kindle Keyboards as they bricked by buying used models on Ebay, but finally bit the bullet and got a new Kindle.  In many ways it is much less user-friendly than my old model.Specifically:*The advance/pageback buttons on the older model were easier to use when holding the reader in both hands.  Having to use the touch-screen to page advance means you have to let go of the reader, which can be a problem for those of us with mobility issues (arthritis) and/or those who read in crowded conditions such as public transit.*The reading screen is smaller, and there are decreased options for print size and font, which make it harder for readers with visual issues to customize their reading experience* The Cloud Categories do not download to the device and show under ""sort by collections"" - the only collections that show that way are those that you created on the device itself.  Which means that in the 2 weeks since I got the device, I have spent more time re-filing my books and recreating my sorting categories than I have actually reading books.  For those of us with large libraries (600+) and books that were purchased from independent distributors or borrowed from libraries and sideloaded rather than through Amazon itself, it is a HUGE hassle.I suspect that if you only buy Amazon books (which this device seems designed to force you into doing) you may have a different user experience, but for those of us who want more control over our purchasing and reading experience it is a major let-down from previous devices.

S. Schwarz,4,"So light!
","September 28, 2019","Okay, going from a 3rd gen kindle keyboard to the all-new 2019 kindle is like comparing oranges and apples. When the old kindle died I used my fire tablet and was not very happy with the glare on the screen and back light.Pros: Lightweight, front lit, with the usual adjustable font size. Brightness can be fine tuned to perfection. No glare.Wish list: A headphone jack. I rarely used it on the old kindle but it had a speaker. I don't have bluetooth headphones. I also preferred the ability to page forward or backward with buttons on both sides of the old kindle. Many times I held it in my left hand, now not really an option.Cons: My bad, but I have a lot of books I haven't read yet. Can't pass up a sale I guess. Having to move them one by one from the cloud to the new kindle was a royal pain in the a**. Also, something's glitchy 'tween my new kindle and goodreads. I am not amused. Again, I received an email from goodreads that I finished a book that I was only 24% into. I am NOT reading this book for the second time! I would assume this is also messing with my goal of reading 70 books this year. Last but certainly not least, the battery drains faster than the old kindle, even with the brightness at 12 and in airplane mode.Price was the deciding factor for this kindle. $5 trade in and 25% off isn't too bad though I doubt this kindle will live as long as the 3rd generation, which was 8 years old I believe. I guess I will work on my to-read list so I won't have so many to transfer next time.

J. Bush,5,"Sometimes basic is best
","August 17, 2019"," I got an early kindle in 2011 but it was just clunky and slow and I ended up only using my Samsung Note 3 to read my kindle books so I sold it while in vet school.  Full circle-- as my Note 8 gets really drained easily since all the updates, I kind of wanted something just for reading. The oasis screen size was tempting, but the prices of all kindles was not nice. Waterproof would be handy in my life but in the end, price won out.  It's got a good feel, turns on fast, settings options and lighting are good. The tactile response is crummy compared to my cell phone, so there's a lot of double/triple taps, but it's not enough to turn me off. I mostly (if there's ANY light) use it with the light off, in pitch black, setting to 1 is enough and not too bright even for my sensitive eyes, and I don't get fatigue.  I've never gone beyond half way on light scale even in bright summer light.Offers are unobtrusive and only in library setting. If you don't turn the screen off it will eventually put on an image as a ""screensaver"".When loading my kindle library I was very angry when it said I was out of room after only 40 books, but then I saw it had tried to load my audible stuff too and it filled it up very quickly. After deleting those it fit all my books, textbooks, and pdfs with room to spare. But audible is not possible on this thing.Response time from turn on is very fast.

It’s basically like having one of those 1980 Mac desktops shrunken down a handheld size and without the charm.  For users who are accustomed to reading on their tablet or phone using the app, do not buy this product.  The Kindle app is so much more sophisticated than the actual Kindle hardware that it’s laughable.  Say farewell to shopping for books in colour or seeing favourite book covers in colour.  That technology is not supported by any Kindle.  Second, at the end of a book there is an option to give the book a star rating, but not to write a review.  It’s no wonder that virtually every book that has even 1 review has 4+ stars on Amazon.  And forget writing a review after following through to the store to find the access link.  The keyboard is archaic and the predictive text doesn’t know words like “the” or “and”.  Opening and closing books, scrolling from one screen to another - there is no continuous scroll feature for moving from page to page within the books -  it all moves slower than molasses in January.  I have to wonder if the Kindle uses a first generation processor because the screen looks like it’s one generation off from being amber or green.  Speaking of old timely computers, if readers enjoy using the reverse colour scheme and reading on a black screen with lighter lettering, that’s also not an option for Kindle.  Literally the only thing this product has going for it is that it’s lightweight - comparable to a tablet.  In fact, close this page and just buy a tablet instead.

Jim Wohlenhaus,3,"The Front Light is Great!
","May 14, 2019","I have a earlier version of a Kindle with the various buttons and I wish this one had the buttons and the light.  Or, the earlier version with a light.  It is a touch screen which makes it hard to hold  and read without doing all sorts of different operations.  I like to go to bed early and lie there and read for an hour or so.  Trying to hold this item while lying on your back will eventually get you somewhere you don't want to be.  The frame around the Kindle is not big enough to hang onto without touching the scree.  I finally had to go to landscape mode so I could hold onto the Kindle with my left hand as that is where the top of the frame is and it is a little larger.Also, I have not found the list of books downloaded.  I have to go to the Amazon web site and pretend I am moving a book to this Kindle.  That way, it is the one that comes up when I turn it on.It would be nice if there was an owner's manual available.  And I still do not know if I ever turn it off or not.  All it asks you is if you want to clear screen.  I don't believe you can turn it off because as soon as you open the cover (I bought the vinyl cover for it also) it comes to life.Why three stars?  Because I am impressed with the front light.

Cozy Fox,5,"Softer light than the Paperwhite & I love it. Highly recommend!!
","June 26, 2019","I absolutely love this new Kindle. I have the Paperwhite and find the light on that one to have a much bluer hue to the light. This new Kindle has a softer feel in the hand, it's lighter and I prefer the set-back screen  (the paperwhite screen goes all the way to the edge, leaving a slight ridge you can feel on your fingers).This is slightly shorter than the Paperwhite, but I don't mind that at all.KEY POINTS:It feels great in the hand, and if holding heavier readers give you sore hands, you will be very happy with this one.The recessed screen makes it easier for me to readThe light is more comfortable on the eyes, indoors and outThe screen flash does not seem as noticeable as on the Paperwhite and is in fact, almost negligible. Very easy on eyes.I can be a tough customer and I'm extremely happy with this new Kindle, right out of the box.Beyond happy with it.  Highly recommend!

superbeau,5,"Excellent reading device
","June 12, 2019","This is my first Kindle and it is pretty awesome. I bought it because my wife would complain of my light when I was trying to read at night. The Kindle solves that problem nicely with its built-in backlight. I'm also amazed at how easy it is to read in sunlight, which is normally a pain with computer screens and cell phones. It seems to hold a lot of books, connects easily to WiFi, and has outstanding battery life. The touchscreen is a little clunky, but it works fine. I've heard that the Paperwhite has better resolution, but if you're just reading books, this is more than enough. Sometimes is a bummer to only have b/w images, but that's a trade-off I'm happy to make for all of the other benefits.

cindy roof,4,"Enjoyable reader for the price!
","May 2, 2019","I purchased this kindle after a trade-in of my first Kindle which was the Kindle Keyboard.  I am not a constant reader so I did not want to spend alot of money on something I will not use everyday.  I can say that after reading the ""all-new"" Kindle, I am missing my kindle keyboard.  I really miss the page turn button on the new kindle which I wish they had as an option on every kindle available.  BUT I do like the front light for reading at night compared to the Keyboard.I have only had this new kindle for a week, but i know in time i will be happy with my purchase.  And for the money you really can't go wrong.  It is doing the same thing as the Oasis but only a cheaper version.  You are still reading a book!

R. Dennis Hall,1,"It's really all-new this time....Nothing like your old Kindle
","September 1, 2019","The newest Kindle is an excellent Ereader.  I think the print is readable and not noticably different in clarity from the Paperwhite,  This amased me because there is a difference but I did not find it to be noticable or less enjoyable.  I thought the new light for reading was the best feature ever on any entry level kindle.  It's equal to lighting on any other device in funcionality.  I think another of my favorite features was the new smaller size.  This is a small device and this makes it very portable.  It's slightly smaller than the new paperwhite.  One drawback I found was the battery life.  It's not terrible and nothing bothersome but it's definitely, noticably less than others I've had.  To be fair this is also true with the Paperwhite.  I do read alot and I've not yet tried turning the lighting down some because it's not always needed.  I also thought that the device was priced exceptionally high.  I really stand by this.  For 50 bucks you can get a Fire, watch Netflix, listen to music, play on facebook, etc. but to get the basic ereader it costs 89.00?  Don't like that.  However the device is clearly the top of the class and it is distinctively and obviously very improved this time because of the backlighting.  Should you buy it?  You'll love it if you do.After a couple of weeks:The device constantly reboots.  At least three times a day, while I am reading, the device just reboots out of the blue.  Its annoying because each instance takes several minutes.  I feel like about 1/3 of the time Im simply waiting for the device to come back up.This thing has become worthless.  It constantly reboots.  Theres no answer for it and im junking it or putting it on ebay.
"
arlelu,2,"The small size makes it difficult to hold
","July 14, 2019","Cons: The biggest dislike is that there are no places to put your hands when reading. Holding on the bottom makes it top heavy and the sides are small and any touch of the white screen turns the pages.  That is the second dislike. The screen is so sensitive that sometimes it jumps ahead three or four pages. Also I have a hard time highlighting a work to get a definition without several pages turning or highlighting the whole paragraph.Pros: The light makes it easy to read in the dark or near dark without an overhead light. The second pro is being able to refresh memory on the identity of a minor character,  previously introduced,by seeing the list of the characters. The third pro is that it fits into my small purse.(previous Kindle was the one with the keyboard on the bottom, generation 3).

Kim,5,"Wasn't sure how I was going to feel about this...
","September 6, 2019","I love the tactile feel of the pages in a book when you turn them and I also love the feel of holding a book in your hands, so I wasn't quite sure how I would feel about using a Kindle. I will say though, after purchasing one and using it to read through an entire book, I'm a believer now! I've converted over to the Kindle side. Here are some reasons why:I love reading! But I do not like having books just sit on my shelf after I'm done with them. It's a waste of space and they just end up collecting dust. Also, if you've ever had to move apartments/houses, you know how much of a pain it is to move boxes and boxes of books—it's not fun moving books, they're quite heavy!I used to Dog-ear pages to signify that there was a passage there worth noting. This would ruin the pages in the book. Now, with the Kindle you can highlight sentences/paragraphs by simply tapping and holding down sentences/paragraphs until you're happy with the selection. This will ""bookmark"" that sentence or paragraph. You can also export these to your email! You'll get the highlighted notes in .csv format and also a very nice looking PDF once you choose to export them (these will go to the email address linked to your Kindle)! What's also great is you can tap and hold down on an unfamiliar word which will bring up the definition of that word.Battery life is another great thing about this! Yes it does last a week and then some! For this to work though, just make sure you leave your Kindle in Airplane mode and only use WiFi mode to download books that you want to read. Otherwise, if you stay in WiFi mode this will be a huge drain on your Kindle battery.The range of Brightness of the built-in light is great as well. I'll read this at night in bed, on the metro, and also on an airplane without disturbing others around me.If you use Goodreads the Kindle pairs perfectly with that platform—you'll see your book lists and recommendations on your Kindle homepage.The only thing I have to say about this is the touch screen takes a little bit to get used to, but it really isn't that big of a deal.As a side note I also opted to get the NuPro Anti-Glare Screen Protector and the Kindle Fabric Cover.All-in-all, I'm really happy with this purchase and will continue using this!

Rebecca Anderson,5,"Nothing is without flaws, but this Kindle is worth it!
","April 18, 2019","This is my first official Kindle e-reader and I'm in love! For quite some time, I've been using my Kindle Fire to read from the Kindle app (which has really begun to strain my eyes, obviously). So, coincidentally, when I decided to buy an e-reader, this Kindle had just been released. It's very easy on the eyes and weighs so little! The special offers do not bother me at all and $90 is definitely worth how much use I'm going to get out of this thing.My only complaint is that the power/sleep button should be on the top, rather than the bottom of the Kindle. When I'm laying down, I have the tendency to hold it up with my thumbs on the bottom of the device and steady the sides with my index fingers, which causes me to accidentally hit the button. Not a big deal, just maybe something Amazon can improve with future Kindles!Overall, I think it is definitely worth the price for the joy this Kindle brings!

Nita,3,"Light is great!  Touch screen not so much!
","July 11, 2019","The light is great, I love to read in the car at night or in bed with the light out. The ability to change the light level & text size, make that thoroughly enjoyable.  The size and weight is great.  However,  the touchscreen is a real pain. It is always changing when I don't want it to, and not changing when I do.  I do not like having to hit the right side with a finger or knuckle.  It means I have usually have to reposition my hands at every page turn.  With my original Kindle, I could go forward or backward with either hand, without moving them.  I like to read myself to sleep.  Everytime I drop the Kindle, it changes my page, sometimes even losing the book I am in.  My old Kindle had buttons on the side & bottom, to change pages & chapters & make selections.  This one is very difficult to use.  I can't seem to go or forward back a chapter, and when I go to my library , I can't go to the next page unless I enter the page number that I want to go to.  Today, I checked the time (a new feature that I do love) , and accidentally touched something on the screen & lost the book I was reading, and haven't been able to find it.  The back arrow just keeps taking me to wifi, and not to the book I was reading.  I read a lot, and don't know what the name of the book was or the author.  So having to enter every page # & look for it is a real pain.  I finally had to look on my computer at Goodreads to see what I was reading.  That feature is greatly appreciated!  It would be great if you could somehow have a ""recent"" list.  I am disappointed in the battery.  I seem to have to charge it about 2x per week.  My conclusion:  I want the backlight & the time, but give me the old controls for turning pages and accessing items.

Nicholas Arsenault,5,"Convert to Kindle for Good
","November 22, 2019","My last e-reader was my first generation Barnes and Noble Nook years back. I loved it but unfortunately BN has been drifting away from the e-reader game and support.  I have long since used my iPad for reading but cannot read well with it outdoors and have noticed severe eye strain with that. I decided to move forward and purchase the Kindle and this 10th generation of The basic Kindle fit the bill. The other versions of the Kindle are quite nice but didn’t want to pay that much.This has been fantastic so far and have read three books in the past couple months on it. I don’t see or understand some complaints people have. Yes the text and screen resolution is not as high as say the paper white or oasis but the letters are still very crisp. For those saying blurry, how close are you holding that to your face to notice it as such a significant problem? The lighting is perfect and adjustable without causing vision strain at night. There is such great support for books on the Amazon platform and getting Kindle unlimited along with my Prime account has been awesome with it. The battery life is fantastic and with my reading habits I only charge up every couple of weeks and it last me quite a good amount of time. I  highly recommend this for anyone seeking a great basic e-reader at this point in time

MGS,4,"Nice but expensive Simple Kindle given the technology
","July 19, 2019","I like the 10th gen. Kindle and I call it the simple Kindle, as it is like my former years ago SImple NOOK. However, there are odd things, like how you make a bookmark, that are really a brain teaser - why can't you just tap it int he corner to make a bookmark?! Why is it a two tap process? The old Simple NOOK just did it with a tap.  Also it actually doesn't have an OFF - the verbiage is ""Screen Off"" which sort of sounds like it isn't really OFF. Well, that's it though.  I paid to have the ads and ""special offers"" removed, and that was nice until they came back!! After about an hour with support in online chat we just resorted to factory reset, at which point it really kicked in without special offers and all is well.  The light isn't one thing I really wanted but its good.  I bought the ""simple"" Kindle 10th gen because I keep getting sidetracked by email, games and the web on my tablets, whereas in this device it is all reading all the time! I needed that.  So far so good and i like having it - it is VERY light, and easier to hold for reading for long periods than my tablet as well. And it doesn't ""ding"" at me with messages from family I really need to run and read. HAHHA.UPDATE: Battery issues - sometimes it goes along fine at 80-99%, and then blam - it hits the teens. Then it goes along fine with a recharge but then has issues again. After yesterday's recharge, it suddenly bottomed out to 18% and I had not even been reading and it was in its case and dark. Could it be a case issue? I am leaving it out of the case for awhile to see. The case is one that is supposed to turn it off, and the light does go off - but who knows.I would recommend buying a Kindle tablet - even the cheapest one which is less than this device!!! I have the little inexpensive Kindle tablet and it is really a nice device. I also read books on my Lenovo tablet for which if course you can get the NOOK app and the KINDLE app both and have a ball.By the way, someone mentioned it has no cord with it -it does come with the cord - no adapter but it has the Mini USB--USB cord and most of us have no dearth of adapters.  But yes, at this price an adapter should have been something included really

Nicolle ,5,"Love the backlight!
","April 28, 2019","Honestly I’ve always been so skeptical of kindles because I’m someone who loves to hold a book in my hand and turn the pages. The only thing I always hate about books is trying to find a decent book light that worked well. So therefore once I saw that the basic kindle has a built in backlight I had to give it a try.I’m really glad I did because I already love it! It’s extremely light weight and there are so many books to choose from in the prime store. Surprisingly the screen doesn’t hurt my eyes even after reading for hours.The battery is crazy too! I’ve been using it all weekend and have only charged it once and it still doesn’t need a charge.All in all for the price of this you really can’t go wrong...as an avid book reader the built in back light makes it worth it...

Amalia C.,3,"Not as good as previous one
","July 19, 2019","I was happy with my old Kindle but unfortunately it died after only 5 years. Which seems to be the average lifespan these days for electronic items, yet another horrid feature of global capitalism enslaving us into constant consumption and the attendant destruction of the planet.Apart from new stuff not lasting long enough, or needed constant updating, it's never usually better than the old models.I only bought this one because it was cheaper and I'm broke, but I don't find it as good as my old Kindle: it is more flimsy, thinner, doesn't fit well in the cover I used for the old Kindle, the screen resolution is worse. It also seems to have some software glitches, when I tried to delete a letter from my public library about returning an item it froze and kept going into system update mode, but it didn't delete the letter. Very annoying.On the other hand, I was worried that the advertising which I chose only because it was cheaper this way would be obtrusive, but it's not. It works as a screen saver and it doesn't interfere with the reading.Let's hope this Kindle will at least last a few more years...

","April 21, 2019","I'm an obsessive reader with rather eclectic tastes so the Kindle and Kindle Unlimited are perfect for me.  I've only had it 11 days and I've already read 4 books, all of which I really enjoyed.  Also, I have rather severe arthritis so it's much easier for me to hold than a book.  With the light and adjustable font size, I couldn't be happier, plus it's reasonably priced which was important to me.  The only negative was getting it linked to my wireless network as there was no information provided on where I could find the required password.  I went on-line with Amazon chat and between myself and the wonderful service agent, we finally got it sorted out.  If you love reading, buy it.

","August 10, 2019","Decidí actualizar mi kindle del 2015 y Justo en ese momento vi la posibilidad de aplicar al programa de Amazon trade-in así que podía ahorrar unos cuantos dólares. Realmente fue una muy buena compra. Es un dispositivo maravilloso, ahora con la retro iluminación no tengo necesidad de encender alguna luz adicional y es posible controlar la atenuación. Hasta ahora no he evidenciado poca duración de la batería (funciona tan bien como los otros modelos) en general está muy bien pero con funciones de otras kindle que costaban más. Quizás no es paper white y tampoco cambia mucho la resolución ppi pero por ese precio obtuve el dispositivo que siempre quise. La funcionalidad de Audible es asombrosa (poder conectar audífonos bluetooth a la kindle básica es poder disfrutar de audiolibros en cualquier lugar... el asunto es que se acabará primero la batería de los audífonos que la de la kindle)Es una kindle más rápida, las funciones son más ágiles y eso demuestra evolución.Contrario a la anterior kindle (que me decepcionaba un poco por rústica , y por no tener agarre en la parte posterior) esta es estilizada, tiene agarre y se ve mucho mejor.Realmente estoy muy contento con la actualización.

Amazon Customer,3,"After two returns, the third one seems ok.
","July 16, 2019","*Updated 7/29/19*I am on my 3rd 2019 all-new kindle now. Yes, I had to return the first two they sent me. One of them had a horribly defective touchscreen. Depending on where on the frame I would hold the kindle, it wouldn't register ANY touches at all. And the home bar and bookmark bar would randomly pop up when I wasn't touching the screen. The second one they sent me had a dead pixel in the middle of the screen...I couldn't live with it, it drove me insane.Now that I'm on my THIRD kindle, I think I finally have a keeper. The touchscreen seems ok so far (knock on wood). And even though there is some kind of mark or dead pixel, it's much less noticeable than the last one. I don't want to risk exchanging again and getting one that is worse than this.Oddly enough, the lights on this third kindle are warmer than the lighting on my last kindle. I am not sure if they changed the LEDs they are using or what, but when I had both kindles lit up side by side, the last one was much bluer. This one is much more of a neutral white. And honestly, I prefer it because I'm usually using the light in bed at night, and the less blue lighting, the better. And while it's the same model number, the case itself appears whiter and brighter, and the ""kindle"" logo on the front is slightly bolder.*Original Review 7/16/19*I got this 2019 kindle in white to replace an old, but very usable, kindle touch from 2012.The lights are nice to have, however it would be great if they were a warmer white. I understand that they can't do both at this price-point, but considering the fact that most people will be using these lights when the room is dark, a warm white would've been the better choice in my opinion.The other thing that bugs me is that I can't find any option to do a ""list mode"" view, like what my kindle touch had for the home screen. Instead, you see rectangles of the book covers, and only 6 fit on a page. This does NOT work well on a tiny black and white device. Some of my books, I can't even make out the title or author and can only see an image of the cover which I may or may not recognize, depending on how familiar I am with the book (I have a lot...A LOT of ebooks). My previous kindle had a list view of the title and author, neatly organized and easily visible. I'm not sure why they can't include this option for those of us that prefer it. I've gone into the advanced settings where you are supposed to be able to control the home screen options, and there is no option there to change this layout style. Hopefully, Amazon is listening and they add this in a future update. I also wouldn't oppose an inverted colors option in a future update.The pixelating of the text seems a bit more visible thanks to the fancy lights. Making the font a little bolder seemed to help this.Besides these few things, the kindle 2019 functions just fine (but so did my old kindle touch). I snagged it with a 25% discount from a trade-in on top of the prime day price of $59.99. It's a solid basic kindle and the price was great, but I find myself wishing I had gone with the paperwhite instead (and I also wish they had the newest paperwhite in...well, white).

J. Ap,4,"Great for its cost, but not without some issues
","August 7, 2019","This is my first Kindle since I lost my Kindle Keyboard many years ago.Overall I am very satisfied with it, and did not realize how much I missed having one. However this is not without some things that I dislike.The resolution (as noted from many others) is rather poor. I am only using this for reading books (no comics) but there are times that the text is rather faint. Its not un readable but it is a bit distracting. One way to help this some is to increase the font size (maybe a bold font) and it makes it not as bad.The back light (while convenient) is very much blue, and harder on the eyes when it is dark in the room. I have lowered it to is lowest setting which makes it a little easier, but still a bit blue.I also had troubles with the whispersync and the audible app staying synced. Found this to be there was a software update for the Kindle that I had to manually update as OTA did not detect it.Overall for the cost I am happy with the unit. I would prefer the higher resolution and better back lighting, but that would have required going to the paperwhite which was more expensive than I wanted, and honestly I am not a fan of the glass screen that would show fingerprints (pet peeve for me).I picked it up on Prime day with the 3 months of unlimited free and I am pretty satisfied with my purchase.

I thought that would be OK if I didn't have to be bugged by those special offers and / or proactively opt out of them at some point, hopefully before ""special"" charges started kicking in.  Didn't work.  When setting the Kindle up I was still bugged by that sort of spam.  Also, the old physical buttons for some functions have been removed on this newer version and those functions are now touch screen activated.  Just like in infotainment systems in cars, sometimes a few physical controls (knobs, buttons) are nice to have - more intuitive and less of a nuisance for some of us.  On the plus side, the white background is an improvement.

Bradford S.,3,"Battery life is awful and fuzzy font with light on.
","July 24, 2019","Another update. I had to do a hard reset to get it to fully charge and hold a chargeUpdate: mine will not hold a charge. After charging for two days it recently went dead withing 4 hours with no usage.  I'm going to charge it one more time to see if it will hold a charge or contact Amazon for a replacement. I've never had a device that won't hold a charge.I waited until I had the kindle for two weeks before writing this review. Overall it's a good e-reader but I wouldn't pay full price for it.  I bought it on Prime day with a significant savings. I definitely think it's worth it at that price point. Overall, the front lighting is very good. The low ppi makes the font slightly fuzzy when lighted but in the sun or normal light it isn't as apparent. My biggest gripe is batter life.  The first week it lasted 5 days with me only reading for about 2 hours and downloading some books.  I charged it back up and it seemed to only last 3 days without me doing any reading. Just last night I had 30% battery, I read for an hour and it dropped to 19%. The ""sleep"" modes seems noy to be much of a battery saver.  I will try turning off wifi and manually turning the screen off in hopes of increasing the life of the battery.  But if you are a heavy reader, you may find yourself charging every 2 days.To summarize buy it at a discount price if you need an e reader.

Easy to hold and use, and syncs with the Kindle app on my phone so I can read when I'm in line at the store or wherever else I might be without my Kindle, although it is lightweight and small enough I could keep it in my purse if I wanted to. Unlike my phone, I don't have to worry about notifications distracting me. I only wish the touchscreen for highlighting text wasn't so choppy. I do like just touching the side of the screen to turn the page rather than having to swipe. Very fast and basically unnoticeable and I don't have to shift my hand out of its holding position to do it. Lightweight, I haven't had to charge it yet in the two weeks I've been using it. Get a knockoff cover for it. Lots of cute designs available for a fraction of the cost of the official ones. I prefer a physical book to an ebook, but this is the only way I actually get it done. However, with Kindle books I can highlight the interesting points and go back to them or share them with someone. Can't do that with a regular book. Get one today!!!

Cat Mom,5,"Large Print for Low Vision Readers
","July 23, 2019","I was so excited about purchasing this Kindle on Prime Day that I tracked the delivery all the way to my front door. It was easy to set up right out of the box. As an avid reader with macular degeneration, I found it increasingly difficult to locate my favorite books in large print and it was cumbersome at best to use a magnifying glass for reading. This Kindle is a great vision aid for those with macular degeneration or low vision. The book magnifier makes reading enjoyable! I can even bookmark a page to remember where I left off. The only improvement would be to offer the magnifying option for all aspects of the Kindle not just for the books I am reading. With low vision, the navigation bar and recommended books are difficult to see.  I make my book purchases on my mobile device, which is easier for me to see. Overall, I recommend this Kindle for anyone tied to a magnifying glass to read their favorite books. It will open up your world again in so many ways. And yes, I love to turn the actual pages of a book, but I also like to see what I am reading.  Kindle has made this possible again.

The touch screen is sluggish and I really don't like how the screen ""flashes"" when you go to turn a page. I do like the battery life and the light weight of this Kindle.

Michelle N.,5,"Easy to use
","April 28, 2019","I’m enjoying this kindle. I like the way the lighting is for reading in the dark. I was still using an old kindle with actual buttons so the touch screen has taken some getting used to.  Sometimes I accidentally turn the page by bumping it. I like that it gives you an idea how much time is left for each chapter. It makes it easier to decide if you should keep going just to finish the chapter or not. It’s easy to adjust the font size and the brightness, too. One bummer thing is I can’t seem to use the scrabble game that I played on my older kindle. All in all it’s a great kindle.

War2d2,5,"Vast improvement over my first-gen Touch
","July 5, 2019","I had an old first-gen Kindle Touch That never got as much use as it probably should have for what I paid for it. I liked it fine, but the lack of a light and the unresponsive screen made it more of a pain to use than just putting up with the eye strain from my Kindle Fire. Amazon had a trade-in deal that made it a $40 decision to upgrade, and I’m so glad I did. The difference is amazing. The built-in light is a killer app, and the touchscreen is 1000x more responsive. I’ve already finished two novels in the three months I’ve owned it, which is saying something for me. Can’t recommend it enough.

K. McCaffrey,3,"Love Kindle but battery life questionable
","May 9, 2019","I love Kindle e-readers and I decided to upgrade from my older paperwhite model.Always easy to set up to my account.What I don't like is the battery, I've had a week or so and have to charge it 3 times.  Goes from 100% to 67% in a day.  This was supposed to have battery life of ""weeks"".Amazon changed how you can sort or filter.  The older model hid a title you loaded to a collection, now it stays on the main list as ""unread"", unless you read the book and marked it as ""read"" then filter on ""unread"".  For people who have hundreds of books this is an actual pain.  GoodReads made me change my password as I had to mark a lot of books as ""read"" or ""unread"" (until I got the hang of how to filter) on Kindle.Overall I will continue to be a Kindle e-reader customer but I won't upgrade until the current e-reader dies.Suggestion to Amazon for next upgrade:  Allow user to download the entire collection instead of having to download all the books separately.  If it can be done now I couldn't find it in the manual.

SanDiego Shopper,4,"The size of this 2019 Kindle w/a light is what got my attention-very lightweight.
","June 4, 2019","I probably own about 4/5 kindles--I do love to read. I'm usually reading out of my Oasis, but it can add weight to a purse. Because this new one takes up little room-both size & weight-wise-I decided to give it a try. The size is perfect, for me. I've found that the battery does need charging a lot, but then so do my other kindles. The touchscreen on this new kindle doesn't seem to be as sensitive as the others I own, as I am always having to double or triple tap to turn the page.  At my 3rd week of ownership, I've had to restart it twice..it wouldn't start up when I opened the cover. I'm keeping my eye this one..I really do like it-but I'm hoping it 'straightens up', so to speak as it's making me nervous. I loved the Kindle Voyage that I owned, but it froze up on me two years after I bought it. I'm hoping this one doesn't do the same.

Cindra L Wallin,3,"Flashing of screen background. Disappointing.
","April 29, 2019","Disappointing. The screen flashes black to white background each time you tap an icon or turn a page in a book. Very annoying. Kindle customer service could not provide an answer as to whether it can be set to a black background for bedtime reading, even though it flashes black.  The text detail is slightly fuzzy, not as crisp as my iPad. Only advantage that I can see to this reader is daylight reading.

KeenJane,2,"Can't listen to audiobooks except through bluetooth, and even then, can't access Library Audiobooks.
","September 30, 2019","This is my first Kindle device ever.Let me begin with my specific reason for going Kindle. I have been using a 7 year old LG  tablet for reading e-books and listening to audio books for about 2 years now. It's been fine but the battery life is atrocious and it charges really very slowly (I'm talking 40% charge gain for overnight) so I've been looking to upgrade. I realised that my library app is basically the ONLY thing I use it for so I should just get an e-reader.Of course my first thought was the Kindle!THE PROS:- I love the anti-glare screen, this makes it 1000% easier to read on my down-time at work. without the nasty glare from the lights. Even my boss was impressed with the anti-glare screen.- low-light reading, for not waking up my spouse in bed, or I can read when my spouse is watching TV without turning the lights on.- massive storage, Books don't take up a lot of space so even a small amount is plenty- ability to access my borrowed library books, this was THE SINGLE most important feature for me. And it works great. I click ""send to my kindle"" and it's immediately there. Thumbs up.- and the battery life is insanely awesome. I think I used it for 2 full weeks before I needed to charge it.However, I do have a couple of negatives (hence the 3 star rating).THE CONS:- It's small. I mean SMALL. It's definitely smaller than I expected, the screen is the size of my phone. I prefer to see more of the page at once to aid my reading comprehension and speed, and that's just *not* possible with this screen.- It's really small, I mean it. I can't even put my non-holding hand down because even on the smallest fonts you can only see 1-2 paragraphs at a time.- There is a lag on the screen when you do anything. Turning the page gives like a weird shadow of the current words before transitioning (not flipping, but like blending into) to the new page. It's bizarre and distracting.- Viewing my kindle library is more difficult to manage and maneuver through than I think it should be. If the Free Public Library's free app is easier to manage, then there's an issue.MAJOR CON:- Apparently the ONLY way to listen to audiobooks is through bluetooth. And I still havent been successful in that regard. This is a HUGE problem for me. I either need to invest in bluetooth headphones which won't always work for me because of TMJD and ear pain issues. *OR* I need to invest in bluetooth speakers.- AND I need to invest in a bluetooth aux converter for my car. Which is the main place I listen to audiobooks. That's in addition to the above, not in place of. So for now I'm still using my old tablet that is barely alive for audio.I mean, maybe it's my fault for not checking the specs close enough, but I saw that it was audio compatible in the specs and the reviews and the question responses and I assumed that there would be a headphone/aux jack.CONCLUSION: I like it, it works. However there are a lot of reasons I wish I hadn't bought this exact one. The screen is shockingly small. and there's no headphone/aux jack. And I am aware that this is one of the lower end models, but I still expected better. There seems to be no reason for these issues except out of spite for the lower end device users. Like, I'm not going to go out and spend $100 MORE on a better one if you can't get the cheap one right.EDIT: I was ready to come back with egg on my face after successfully connecting the Kindle via bluetooth to my husband's BT speaker, but then I realised that there is not mechanism to transfer library audiobooks to the Kindle to play them over BT. Maybe it works for purchased books? I don't know. Because I borrow my books. From the library. With which this is not compatible. So my ENTIRE reason for purchasing this device was for naught if I still am forced to use my old tablet for audiobooks.I dropped it down to 2 stars after not being able to transfer library audiobooks to the Kindle. I'm keeping it at 2 because I can still use it for e-books, which I basically only read at work. So it's not ENTIRELY useless. But suffice it to say I'm disappointed in this and I wouldn't have purchased it if I had known.

The Reader,3,"My all new Kindle
","August 5, 2019","I want to use this Kindle just for reading books. I have some books on it from putting them on my Ipad and an old Kindle. I wanted this one for reading books only. The light is fine although I reduced when I read that having it too bright would use up battery. As far as directions well I am an old lady and I can't figure them out from looking at my computer directions. I know there is a dictionary but I can't find it. I go through many pushes here and there to find the book I want. I have managed to do that but don't know how to get rid of books I don't want on this Kindle. I find if I don't touch the lower screen it doesn't turn the page for me and likewise the opposite site to return to a page as sometimes the pages run away from me. So it is hard for me to learn tech stuff. Easy as pie for a young person.
"
Constance S. Reed,2,"What a disappointment.
","May 25, 2019","This was smaller than expected and didn't fit into any of my covers, had to buy a new one. The lighting has a greyish tinge that took some getting used to and at least once in every reading session it will just shut down or go dark.  I either have to restart it all over again or go into settings and fiddle with the lighting.  I would have sent it back but I traded in my perfectly good old kindle for it so I would have been without one.  I'll just muddle through until I can afford an upgrade to a abetter model.
"
Kat,5,"Love it!! But wish it came in gray!
","October 20, 2019","I love this little thing! The slight reduction in size makes it slide easily into my purse so I can take it everywhere! The touch screen has much better response times than older Kindle models, and the lettering looks sharp and easily readable.The font sizes on this are different from on the paperwhite. I've always felt that the paperwhite font sizes jumped straight from ""too small"" (4) to ""too big"" (5). The new Basic fixes this -- using the Ember font, this kindle's size 3 is like the paperwhite's 4, this kindle's 4 is an in-between size the paperwhite doesn't have, and this kindle's 5 is like the paperwhite's 5. I like having more choices over the font size and to me the new size 4 is the perfect size for comfortable reading.The light on this is about the same as the current kindle paperwhite, but not as good as the older versions of the paperwhite. The picture with two black kindles has a 2015 paperwhite on the left, and this 2019 basic kindle on the right. This one one has a slightly bluer light, which isn't as nice for reading at night. I went to a local electronics store to compare to a 2018 paperwhite display model, and it has the same bluer color, so this is a matter of older vs. newer, not paperwhite vs. basic.The color you choose for this kindle can cause some optical illusions involving the screen. The pictures on this review with one black kindle and one white kindle are both the same 2019 basic model with the same settings. I've shown a range of backlight settings so you can compare for yourself.As shown, the border on the white makes the screen look darker and browner when unlit. When you read with the light on, it can make the light look harsh and unnatural. But I have found that for any given room lighting, there will be 1 or 2 backlight settings that look OK with the white border. The black border has downsides too - it can make the screen feel smaller and crowded.I didn't like the white one at first, but after spending a few days with both, I've decided I like the white one better - it feels more spacious, is more relaxing for long reading sessions, and seems to cause less contrast and eye strain. But I hope for future models they'll consider using light gray instead of white, which I think would be the best or both worlds.

Mark L Trahan,4,"Best Reader There Is
","September 24, 2019","I'm not just a reader, I'm a constant reader.  Brushing my teeth, going to the bathroom, sitting in the hot tub, at my desk at work, riding the bus, walking down the street -- like I said, a constant reader.  Thanks to Kindle technology, I get to indulge all the time, and can carry around the 14-15 books I'm reading simultaneously at any given time without having to drag a wheel barrow around.  It's great!Now, after about ten years of trying several devices, I have to say the Kindle Reader is the best reader there is, period.That doesn't mean it's a great reader, it's just the best one you can buy.  I've tried several Kindle Fires, which have only lasted about a year apiece, and I've also tried using my Galaxy S2 Tablet as a reader, which also failed after a while (the device would simply freeze after reading a page or two, after about seven months' use).  For some reason, Kindle Reader app just isn't very stable anywhere except for on the Kindle Reader.So I'm back to using a simple Kindle for my reading.  It's the only device you can rely on for that function, and at that you have to buy a new one every year.  And that's the Best Reader you can get.  Believe me, I've researched this issue thoroughly.As for battery life:  the website claims that the battery can last for a week.  In my experience, that's only true if you turn off the device and let it sit somewhere quietly for a week without using it at all.  Otherwise, reading it all the time like I do, you'll need to recharge it at least once a day, even in Airline mode.Happy Reading!

Amazon Customer,1,"Software changes within the last week unacceptable
","June 18, 2019","This reader was a great replacement to my old Kindle without a light. The type was dark and crisp. However, a change was made to the software recently and now the letters are no longer black but a gray tone which makes it extremely difficult to read.  I was sent a replacement since the tech thought it had been a hardware issue on that particular device. I was sent a new Kindle which still reverts to gray type when the page loads. Until engineers can correct the problem with the type, I have had to revert to my smartphone to read my Kindle books.  This Kindle is now very inferior and I would not recommend purchase until Amazon can resolve the gray type issue.

Joseph,4,"Great as a reader
","May 30, 2019","As a reader this works perfectly. I can adjust everything to my personal reading preferences and it's wonderful. However trying to sort my massive library is a chore. Sometimes it's slow moving from page to page. Sometimes it doesn't register a touch command. And my files can't be sorted into any kind of ""reading order"" like I can on my iPad or iPhone app. I can only sort books by ""title"" or ""recent"". Which is kind of a pain when say sorting the Dune series. Children of Dune comes before Dune in the alphabet...not in series order though.

Be sure to buy a cover with it though-- just makes it easier to use.

4catsinidaho,5,"Charging and set up procedures!
","June 10, 2019","Before I go into likes or dislikes I want to clear up some consistent misconceptions about charging and setup/syncing. If this is your first Kindle ignore my review.One: charging, you can try using the included cable and your USB ports on your laptop. I tried three USB ports on each of two new high end laptops and it did not charge.  Chalk this up  to the fact that not all USB ports can be used for charging although this was commonly done ten years ago. So, if this is not your first Kindle, use the charger you're using with the last one. I'm using a 9W Amazon wall charger that came with a previous Kindle or Kindle Fire device and am using for the base Kindle 7 I already have. No problems.After signing on to WiFi and registering my new Kindle, I wondered how to easily transfer the books I have on my Kindle 7 which I plan to continue using. I've set up four Kindles, three Kindle Fires, and countless Kindle apps on phones and tablets. Somehow,  syncing just happened, I thought . Not this time so I called the ""expert"" and, indeed,  I was told to sync the new Kindle with ALL my cloud content,  then download the books I wanted one by one.  WHAT? I have a total of over 1000 books,  about 100 of them are on my old Kindle and I wanted them on the new one.  I gave up and just downloaded the book I was currently reading to the new Kindle and went to bed.When I got up I had a hunch....I went into devices and content,  and made the new Kindle my default device. Then I went to the old Kindle to content on device which brought up the list of books only on that device,  checked them all, much easier than picking the short list out of the 1000 titles in all content, then picked transfer to device and the new device from the drop down menu. Now both Kindles have the  same content and sync perfectly. But, this is NOT what the Kindle ""expert"" told me to do, but it IS the way to get your old Kindle content to your new Kindle without losing your mind in the process. I think the key is setting the new Kindle as your defsult. Everyone who was told the ""pick and choose"" method by the Kindle ""experts"" deserves an apology from Amazon.Back to the device experience itself.  I'm loving it. I did not expect such a marked difference in weight and thickness between this and the base Kindle 7, but, it's considerably lighter and thinner, pleasant to use. I have never been able to comfortably read on a backlit device,  the front light is great.  I keep the light set at 10,  it's perfect and does not strain my eyes. For people wondering about the low 167dpi, it's a whole different experience, black on white, than the same 167dpi on the Kindle 7 with a black on grey background.So far, my favorite ereading experience,  once set up and charged.

Granted I had an older version, Kindle with the keyboard from 2010 I guess,  but it was solid, navigating a search or simple page turns worked well and it was just a better generation.  This generation has poorly laid out menus or accessibility to your inventory of books and the touch screen is poor.  Based on other reviews I admit I purchased the lower end model, but to go from under $90 to almost $250 with almost nothing in between quality wise (except for the water proofing) to pick from at 129, to me is a problem.  I would have returned the new one, for another if there was a reasonably priced option in between, but for now I'm very disappointed.

John Guarino,5,"This new Kindle now with built-in front light works well for me
","October 4, 2019","My wife has a Paperwhite that she really likes. I had gotten a couple years ago a standard v8 Kindle that hasn't any front light. I'd read it at night wearing a headlamp, like I do for reading magazines. I thought I'd try this new Kindle that comes with the built-in front light and it turns out I really like it. Even in the living room I don't need to turn on the chair side lamp. I keep the Kindle front light set at 11 or 12 even during the day. At night it's not too bright. I find this Kindle easy to read. It fits into the v8 Kindle enclosure I have but I rarely use that.Back in 2017 from Amazon I purchased a Universal tablet tripod mount. The Kindle fits perfectly in it.Then the mount goes onto a Manfrotto mini tripod.Now the Kindle is at a perfect height and I avoid excessive neck flexion (I'm a retired Physical Therapist) when reading with this combo on a table or desk. When hand holding, the mini tripod is a perfect handle that again puts the Kindle at an appropriate height to avoid neck problems.I know, I'm a dork but a neck pain free dork... (most of the time):-)Now that I'm retired I'm doing LOTS of reading. The battery life so far seems as good as my v8 Kindle that I got a couple years ago. It's actually still working fine but I wanted to try the front light and the price was right for this model.

Erin Penn,3,"Sometimes stalls but mostly fine
","July 7, 2019","After several months, I am still missing my keypad - but this works mostly fine.My old kindle, which lasted over five years, finally gave up the ghost in a horrific death of lines and I tried to replace it with a refurbished product of the same type. But that died in days. After a second attempt with similar results, I broke down and got the brand-new redesigned kindle. Touch screen only, built-in light mandatory, no keyboard. I previously choose no backlight and  with a keyboard - that is what I want. I want something I can use late into the night and not be looking at a glowing screen. My eyes need the rest.The paperwhite is nice. The battery life has been fine. The couple of times I've cranked up the build-in light, it has been good.I have have a couple of issues with the touch screen. About once or twice a book the screen freezes and won't respond to touch. I need to wait about a minute not doing anything until it responds again. This happens with and without the wi-fi active - with long and short books - at least 20 minutes into reading. Sometimes the wait is quite long (walked away, took a bathroom break) and I end up rebooting. Every time I am terrified, is this the time I get screen death again - a screen death without an option of using keyboard to double check? I got one button - on and off - and even that doesn't always respond. I got a lot of stuff on the kindle and I don't want to have to recreate it for a fourth time this year.You pay for what you get and I did choose the cheapest option of the reading tablet product line (I did pay for the no ads version). Still, I expect a kindle keep responding in the middle of reading a book when the wi-fi is off.

Jessica,5,"It's a bookshelf in a small, lightweight package.
","November 27, 2019","This is the only Kindle product I've purchased aside from the apps on other devices. It's really small and lightweight and you can adjust the brightness of the backlight. For mine, the battery life is a bit bipolar. Sometimes the battery last a while and sometimes it doesn't, but it will last a week (about 5 days) on 1 charge if your mainly just reading (last longer on standby). I don't think it actually powers down but you can turn the screen off (I like a power off option). Also, the processing speed on mine takes a few seconds and sometimes a few touches. I think the Nook paperwhatever (similar model) from Barnes and Nobles did the same thing. Basically, if you want to read without carrying around several books this is right for you. I also think this works for those of us who have small hands and lay down while reading.

The smaller size is awkward to hold but even more is concerting is the touch screen paging. Either it is too quick and pages several pages. It is then necessary to struggle with the page back function. Oh the frustration. At other times it is necessary to touch the screen many times to turn the page. More frustration and my attention has been distracted from the book.I also am not happy with downloading my books from the cloud.

Internetshoppingjunkie,5,"Anyone debating on Paperwhite reader vs Kindle Fire
","July 30, 2019","Ok, I already reviewed. See below. H noere's the question I'm nagged about through email. This is an e reader. Nothing more. Nothing less. The only internet you have is the Kindle store. No Google. No Bing. Kindle. This a plus as well as a drawback.  Don't read a lot? Buy a Fire tablet. Same price plus internet access to everything thru wifi.Anyone debating on Paperwhite reader vs Kindle or whether they need both, here ya go. I love this reader. I have both a Kindle fire and a Kindle app on my phone and use both regularly. I've been debating on getting just a reader for awhile, but the price always stopped me. Come-on, what the hell Amazon, as much or more than a Kindle fire??? It does one thing. Books. With no color.  Anyway, if you have no problem with your battery life or holding the weight of your tablet, don't get a reader. If you don't care about notifications, messages, emails popping up on your phone while reading, stop shopping. If you don't read much outside in sunlight, I'm not sure it's worth it to get this. However,  I love this thing. It's small (seriously really small), therefore incredibly easy to hold, stays charged forever even with binge reading, and, my own personal selling point, is able to be read in the sun. There is virtually no difference between reading inside vs outside in direct sunlight. The way this thing is lit up lessens eye strain compared to the Fire or phone. Not sure how they managed that, but it's awesome. Hope this helps the indecisive.

I don't need to see the cover or amazons intro . Other than that .. had I an option to get a new OLD kindle I probably would have . Don't love this one , but it does what I need it to do . The audible didn't need or have I used  so not an important feature

Jesse,5,"The built-in light makes a huge difference when reading at night! Great value.
","May 18, 2019","I had the Kindle 6th generation and this latest Kindle is definitely an improvement because it's now easier to read at night. The software is same, with the exception of adding the built-in light feature which is the biggest Improvement!The pluses is being able to customize the type of font, the size, and page orientation, then save your settings, which allows multiple users. The size is perfect because it's portable and now you can read anywhere with the built-in light, which has not affected the battery life thankfully. The other expensive Kindle reader models have more storage however,  I've never run out of room with this Kindle reader! It's a not an issue for me.Unlike the old model I had,  this one goes into sleep mode when you close the cover and wakes up when you open the cover.  It always remains on sleep mode so it never completely shuts down .The minus is sometimes it freezes on sleep mode for long periods of time.The processor is somewhat slow/clunky like the old model I had ( minus one point). I wouldn't read magazines or comics on the reader, I'd use my fire color tablet instead, that seems to be a better experience for me .Overall an excellent value for the money. I recommend this for folks who love to read and need a small portable device that goes everywhere with you.Although it has the old USB connector charging system,  you don't need to charge it for several weeks, so it's not an issue. I can charge it when I'm not using it.11/9/19 update:  the software has been updated and performance is improved so it's not as slow and clunky as it used to be. While out of town town for a family emergency,  I left it on for several days and it didn't drain my battery!  It woke up pretty quickly on sleep mode.It now turns five stars!

Bama Babe,3,"Smaller than Original Kindle Touch
","September 10, 2019","I love my original kindle touch.  However, it is aging and because I was not sure how much longer it would last, I bought a new kindle touch on Prime Day.  It is smaller than the original but the screen size appears to be the same.  However, I do not like the fact that I can't make the font size as large as I could get it on my old kindle touch.  And it is very hard to get the usb cord into the kindle to charge.  I have had to force it in several times and it is not an easy fit. In fact, I couldn't get it in the slot the first few times I tried.  I looked on Amazon for a cord to buy but saw they only had a plug for the wall.  What's up with that?  Shouldn't the cords all fit the same way for the same devices?  I wonder if this is a defect on mine or has anybody else had this problem.  This kindle holds a charge pretty well, however, not as long as the original.  I guess for me, I was looking for the same features and reliability of my old Touch but with a backlight provided.  On this model/edition the backlight is the only saving grace. I am a little disappointed.So to summarize:GOOD:  backlightBAD:  font size not able to get large enough for me - not anywhere near as large as my original would go  not easy to get charging cord into charging slot - almost seems like a defect  charge doesn't last as long

MV Martin,3,"Not what I expected
","July 19, 2019","I understand this is a basic reader and definitely comes with no frills. In fact , that is exactly what I wanted. I do wish it was just a little larger. An extra 1 to 1.5 inches would do wonders. I like the feel and look of the device. The screen isn't completely anti-glare, which is to be expected, but it is very minimal glare that does not interfere with viewing the words on your screen.However, I do not like the lag in the touch screen. It seems to need a few seconds before catching up with your commands. I also find it a little annoying how the screen kind of flickers before the page is turned. I do wish it was more seamless. You also need to make sure that you are touching deliberately and exactly where you want or the screen won't respond. But you won't know that for a few seconds because you are waiting for the delay to catch up.Definitely not a tablet. If that is what you are looking for, get the Fire or something similar.  I feel like this device is not up to Amazon standards and still has a lot of improvements needed. I'm not completely thrilled with this purchase but I won't return it either. It serves a basic purpose and has met that purpose.

Sea Turtle,5,"Enjoying my new Kindle
","July 13, 2019","I have only had this a few days now and am still learning about all the features. I am also a first-time kindle owner. Previously I have used the kindle app on my full size iPad. I am loving the size, weight, and portability of this device. I am a little confused on why you cannot completely power down the device, and am not sure I can set the page up to have a black background with white print (which 8 can do in the Kindle app on my iPad.) I am not having any issue with page turning so far (again, it is similar to using the app on the iPad). The battery was at 57% when I took the device out of the box. I did have to put it on the charger after getting a low battery signal last night. So far I am happy with this little Kindle.

Less is More,5,"This basic Kindle has everything I need now that it has light!
","July 18, 2019","I've been wanting a Kindle for a while, but found it difficult to spend the money when my tablet works okay for reading ebooks. However, once I saw that the basic Kindle now has lights, I waited for a sale and bought one. This one has all the features I need (waterproofing and one extra light was not important to me), although I did wonder about the ppi. As I don't usually read graphic novels, my frugalness won and I purchased this one instead of the more expensive Paperwhite version. Buy a cover that will turn your Kindle on and off and you will be all set. If you have a cell phone power cord you don't need to buy anything else. If you can purchase this on sale it's a great deal.

NLM4501,5,"Hubby's Opinion
","September 4, 2019","I purchased this e reader for myself for vacation and I wanted to be able to read outside.  I usually have my books on my Samsung tablet but they are impossible to use outside.  I should have done a little more research before purchasing as this e reader was not for me.  I get 99% of my books from my library's on line site.  They use the overdrive app which is what I was familiar with.  I did not realize that I could not borrow, return, browse directly from the e reader but had to go through the whole Kindle reading app process using another device.  As my husband doesn't have an issue with the kindle limitations - he currently had an old kindle e reader that didn't even have back-lighting - he took this one and I bought another.  I ended up with a Kobo that utilizes overdrive.  Now we are both happy.  He had a new updated e reader and I have exactly what I wanted too.For what it is worth the kindle is a GREAT value about 1/4 the price of the Kobo.  It looks virtually identical to the Kobo, has most of the same features.  The only difference is on my Kobo I can browse, borrow and return books directly from device anywhere I have an internet connection.

Gina,5,"Nothing flashy but does what it’s suppose to do.
","May 8, 2019","My first e reader and I love it! I use it while I’m at work, I work graveyard shift and I just sit in a warehouse by myself so it gives me lots of reading time. Phones and tablets aren’t allowed. After 8 hours of use well roughly 7 hours and 15 minutes it only used 25% of the battery and that’s with the brightness at the highest. Touch screen isn’t as smooth but once I got use to it it didn’t bother me. Once I read a book I don’t care to keep it so getting kindle unlimited is perfect for someone who reads a lot. If all you want to do is read and not save books and you have kindle unlimited all you need is the lowest memory one because kindle unlimited only lets you download 10 books at a time anyways. Light weight and easy to hold while you read. Doesn’t come with a wall charger just a usb cord, my iPad wall charger works fine with it.

hg1311,3,"Get the paperwhite
","October 15, 2019","I have the Paperwhite and wanted to get one for my grandmother. This one was on sale and looked like it was basically the same except for the waterproof and storage. However, it’s not even close to the same.The good: it functions as a kindle should. We haven’t had any issues with it.The bad: The battery runs out quickly. She has to charge it twice a week. Compared to my paperwhite that I only have to charge every other week.Which leads to the next issue where there is no function to invert the screen. I can’t make the background black and the words white. I’m sure this plays into the battery problem.  This is very frustrating and had I known this wasn’t an option on the regular kindle, I would have bought the paperwhite for her.The kindle doesn’t automatically go into sleep mode when I close the magnetic cover, nor does it come on when I open the cover.

","October 17, 2019","I decided to upgrade my 4th generation Kindle reader to this newer model with cover. I am so disappointed. No matter the font size or if I'm using the backlight or not - the letters are ever so slightly **blurry**. Not crisp like an actual printed book or the older 4th gen Kindle model. I'm going to try and stick it out to see if I can get used to it but, I'm not hopeful. It's very noticeable.I did contact customer service and they suggested I upgrade to the Paperwhite model if I wanted a clearer text. I shouldn't have to pay an additional $30 for clearer text. Newer technology isn't always better, especially in this case.

","October 1, 2019","Who knew there'd be an item that's not compatible with my ""All-new"" Kindle? When I'm not reading, I enjoy playing Every Word on my Kindle Touch.  I purchased a new Kindle figuring I could do the same, mais non. I just finished a chat with an Amazon CSR , who was kind enough to try to deliver it, but the chat ended with her/him letting me know that Every Word is not compatible with my new Kindle. S/he didn't know that during our chat. No worries, but Ugh.Four stars, because no Every Word!I will get over this, because there are pluses. I really like the built-in adjustable light, the quality of ink is good, and it's light & compact. I am very happy with the case (Huasiru Safeshell - Café), which took me forever to choose.  I must have scrutinized all of the choices at least three times. The touch screen is very responsive, but it's a new device & will take some time learning to navigate efficiently. As much as I hate to read directions, I will have to spend some time exploring the user's guide.

It was recently stolen passing through PGH Airport security and know I know why.  They have tried to make this new version the equivalent of an I-Phone (which it is not) by making the operation touch screen. It wont ever shut down, the setup tries to trick you into selecting paid services, search is pitiful along with trying to navigate to book reviews.  The 5 star reviews are evidently from those who never had the privilege of owning the old original version of Kindle.

Sabdra,5,"Great device
","August 10, 2019","Love this kindle. The backlight isn't overly bright, even though you do have the option to back it blinding. I keep mine at the lowest possible setting and find that to be fine for my eyes. There isn't any glaring.Sometimes whenever I'm reading I kind of wish I would've have gotten the wifi option too. Especially, if there is a word or phrase that I want to look into a bit more. However, if you take the time to add your kindle to your phone hotspot that would take care of it. My phone company doesn't charge extra for hotspot and I have unlimited data. But I dont keep it on there continuously and I'm always wanting to look stuff up whenever I'm on the trolley ..never fails.  Overall I love it and I've never regretted buying this kindle. Glad I ordered it right out of the gate. It was worth it waiting to get in on the first shippment.The size is just right too. And fits in my small pocketbook with easy. I do however miss the button page turning option that was on my older kindle though. The touch screen makes it more of a two handed item.  The main reason for missing the buttons is that whenever I'm on the trolley going to work I could be able to hold the kindle in one hand while holding on to the railing with the other. But I cant do that with the touch screen kindle and I've had a few near fall moments  letting go to touch the screen to change pages

Since I am limited in space for real books, I had to do something. Reading on my phone's kindle was not a pleasant experience for me. But let me say, I am so excited about this Kindle! It is lightweight and it fits in my purse, which causes me to read more. No more heavy, bulky books that I forget half the time. I can read it in any light just like a real book, and adding the cover which turns the kindle on and off automatically makes me very happy.

Beth,3,"Not perfect, but the lighted screen is a plus
","November 15, 2019","I have mixed feelings about the Kindle. One of the  oddest things to me is that REALLY managing content has to be done from another device! Like, I can't completely delete a book right from the Kindle, I have to go on my laptop to my Amazon account and delete from there. That is just weird. The page turning does not always work right, I can hit the left side of the screen to go back, but it still goes forward. Also in general, this is my first experience with an e-reader, and it does take a bit of getting used to. There are no page numbers,  obviously it is just not the same as holding a book. But, the main reason I wanted it was to be able to read in the dark, and it works so well for that. Also, be forewarned, I was very naive and assumed that there were e books flying around willy nilly for the taking. Even from the library, not all titles are available, especially older books.  I like to read series books, and it is frustrating to find the first 3 books in a series and then not find the rest. I could buy them, but I am too cheap :D all in all I am happy, but it takes some getting used to.

Judy,1,"Much Inferior to my old 2013 Kindle Fire
","July 17, 2019","This product is definitely 100% inferior to my 2013 Kindle Fire--which, sadly, will no longer charge, thanks to a cheap, loose charging port.  Everything about my new Kindle is inferior to my old Kindle Fire.  Rather than an improvement in technology over the last 6 years...everything has gone downhill.  The ""new"" kindle is is much less convenient,  much less easy to use...and just in general a very inferior product. One big complaint: the screen is too sensitive, and too small. When I touch gently anywhere on the screen--something changes!  I have to be extremely careful exactly where I touch the screen. For instance, even creating a bookmark is more difficult than it was before. With the Kindle Fire, this was a simple process. With the new ""improved"" kindle, when I try to create a simple bookmark....I'm likely to come up with something else instead. If I was certain that the new Kindle Fires are the same high quality as my 2013 Kindle Fire, I'd send this new almost-worthless kindle back for a refund and order a Kindle Fire. But I'm now very leery of Kindles altogether--especially because of the many bad reviews I've read about every Kindle fire now on the market.  I also don't like the ads that automatically appear when I turn on my new tiny little Kindle.  What happened? My 2013 Kindle was wonderful in every way--exactly what I wanted!  But now, 6 years later....the technology seems to have gone way downhill.  In summary: an extremely inferior product. Bring back the high quality and ease of use of the 2013 Kindle Fire!!!  (Except for the cheap and useless charging port, of course....)

PJ,4,"Well pleased with Kindle
","June 26, 2019","I purchased the Kindle 10th Generation 2019 reader to replace my 8 year old Nook Simple Touch that was slowly dying. I only wanted a black & white reader and was torn between a new Nook or trying out a Kindle. The price of the Kindle won me over. I have the one with ads but they only appear on the front screen when it's first awakened sort of like a screen saver.  I must say I've been pretty pleased with this little reader so far. I keep it on airplane mode and the light turned off unless I really need it and that way it helps preserve the battery life considerably. I read at least 2 hours a day and the battery lasts about 2+  weeks before needing to be charged (my old Nook's battery lasted twice as long). I do miss the page turner button but the touch screen is easy enough even though I'm still getting used to the touch sensitivity which is a little different from the Nook.  The feature I like best is that I download books from the public library and the download process is so much easier with Kindle and Amazon than it was with Nook and Adobe Digital Editions. Also, I can sync the Kindle with my iPhone for those times I have my phone with me but not the Kindle.Great little e-reader!

JLBR,2,"Sluggish
","July 26, 2019","This new kindle I just bought is a replacement for one my wife gave me three years ago, which is why, when comparing that old kindle with the new one, I realize that, first of all, in three years the technology for this product has remained stagnant. My new kindle feels just as slow, or even slower than the old one, the built in light feature, which amazon is trying to market as new, is not, and basically you’re just being sold the same product with absolutely no tech innovation. Second complaint is the built in ads. Wanting to save some money, I opted for the ads version of the product.  Big mistake. I thought opting in to this would mean getting some ads every once in a while when browsing the store or when in my library, or something like that.  Boy was I wrong. Basically, whenever your kindle is on sleep mode, it really isn’t because your screen is displaying an ad for a book 24/7.  The result? It drains your battery. I left my kindle alone for 24 hours as an experiment and battery life was drained at a rate of 5% for each 24 hours.  My old kindle’s battery life was awesome.  Not anymore.  So while I opted for the ads in order to save me some bucks, I don’t recommend it but I also think amazon is abusing its customer base with such tasteless bombardment.  I will never buy a book advertised on those ads, they don’t even appeal to me. Kindles are already expensive for what they are, and they’re basically designed to keep on generating revenue for amazon via their books sales, customers should not be abused like this, amazon could offer these gimmicks with a discount given we’re just going to buy books from them.  So, honestly, I am quite disappointed with this product, it is expensive, I get bombarded with ads that are draining my battery, and basically as an amazon customer I feel like I am being taken advantage of with this gadget.

Riparian Librarian,3,"Love the built-in light, still can't stand the touch screen
","May 30, 2019","The built-in light on the low-end Kindle models is a welcome new feature, though it does (understandably) cut into the battery life. Unfortunately, it looks like Amazon has no plans to bring back physical page advance buttons on the cheap models. I've never liked touch screens on my Kindles. It's a single-purpose device. Nobody uses it as a tablet. That's what the Fire is for. All the touch screen does is advance the page when my hand accidentally brushes against the screen. I find myself having to hold it gingerly by the edges to prevent that, and if I fall asleep reading and mash a hand against the screen in my sleep, I could wake up to anything. It's an annoying feature and the reason why I docked a couple of stars, but apart from that, this model is well worth the money.

It was just so much easier with the forward/back buttons on both sides of the kindle, enabling use by either your left or right hand. In comparison, the touch screen is glitchy and slow. As has been mentioned by other reviewers, it will either not respond, or respond when your hand is close to but not touching the screen, or flip two pages instead of going to the next or previous page. I'm also not really crazy about the newer operating system, although I've gotten used to it. I love the front lighting, as it makes it a lot easier to read in differing conditions. I do like the smaller size (in comparison to the older keyboard version). All in all, I'm happy with this newer Kindle, but...again...if I had one wish, it would be to have the side buttons back.

Until the day came...I moved out from my country (I'm from Europe) and came to the United States. I took with myself a few books, my favorites. I had a hard time to find books I wanna read in my language here in the States at the decent price and some of them weren't even available. Then I thought I will switch to English books. The reading process was a nightmare! I've been searching new or unknown words in dictionary on my phone, it slowed me down in reading process no more enjoyable...:(Then I thought I will give e-reader a chance!First one I bought was Kindle 8th. I felt like it saved my life! Built-in dictionary saved me many times, while reading English books. The screen didn't have any glare to it. I didn't know there were no light when I bought it, I managed to use it a month and I bought cheap and second hand Nook Glowlight to compare. The front light was just a miracle to me! Then I decided to buy a new Basic Kindle 10th. I only read books, no magazines or comics. First I wanted to buy Kindle Paperwhite 3, but my priority was to have an ability to TURN OFF the light completely, which this model doesn't allow. It was very hard to find this info anywhere.And yes, this Kindle 10th can have the light turned off completely (you can check my pics I've uploaded, Kindle 8th and 10th with light off look pretty the same).I got very lucky because there was a 20% discount on Amazon on used devices. My Kindle was described as ""used good condition"" so I expected some minor wear and tear. But my device came looking like brand new, no scuffs, damages, nothing! I also ordered it WITH ads, but I checked it and realized the Amazon guys turned them off for me for free without me even asking for it! It was so nice! So here is a great plus for customer service!The screen has a bit more glare than Kindle 8th but less than Nook. However, my Nook's battery is more durable!

The ability to change the brightness mirrors my old Paperwhite and I find the text sharp and easy to read. There is a noticeable difference in weight from my old Paperwhite, even with the Amazon case this new Kindle is much lighter weight, perfect for tossing in my purse or backpack for reading on the go. I've had no issues with the pages not being responsive/jumping ahead. I find the menu configuration a little less intuitive than my old Paperwhite, but still very usable and user friendly.

It is so slow so scrolling or clicking anything is irritating. I do not recommend this product at all. Also it is very small, take that into consideration if you're a fan of big screens or books.

SoCal_reader,4,"Good low cosy, lightweight alternative to oaperwhite
","July 8, 2019","I have had several Kindles over the years and love my Kindle Paperwhiite.  Since I carry my Paperwhite with me all the time, I was looking for a lighter weight version.  I bought the older basic Kindle reader but missed the light; so when I saw this new version with a light and on sale, I bought it.  For day to day reading it's great.  The lower resolution is a bit of a problem with images and maps  but I can always look at my higher red version when I am at home.ISo far battery life seems OK and illumination may even be better than my Paperwhite. At $69 it was a great deal.

S. Miller,4,"Good Kindle
","July 31, 2019","My Kindle keyboard (VERY OLD!) got wet and I needed to replace it.  This was a great deal during Prime Day and I'm mostly satisfied.  I really like the front light and I get to try Kindle Unlimited for 3 months.  However, I REALLY miss the mechanical page turn buttons on my old Kindle, which enabled me to page forward or backward, regardless of the hand I was holding the Kindle with.  The touch screen is a little more sensitive and I find myself frequently needing to go back/forth to find the right page.  This Kindle is also significantly shorter (smaller) than my old one.  I miss the extra couple of inches for holding on.  Especially with the touchy screen and lack of buttons, its not as easy or comfortable to hold as I'm reading.  Also, I'm totally underwhelmed with the Kindle Unlimited selections.  Based on what I've seen so far, I won't be paying once my trial is over.

The ppi is horrible. The lighting is mediocre even at it's highest setting. The touch screen isn't smooth at all and really glitchy to be honest.I've read comments about Kindles that stated the experience was better than tablets and cell phones. And that just isn't true. Ten minutes after reading on this Kindle I couldn't wait to hop back on my note 9 which is far superior using the Kindle app. At the end of the day it was another lesson learned.

NN,1,"Issues with holding the battery charge and Glitches
","October 28, 2019","This kindle is a piece of crap. After charging it to a full 100 percent and hour later the charge is less than 50 percent. It also glitches constantly. No matter the number of resets or the amount of books stored on it, the charge does not last the day. These issues occurred on the first day that I received it and the few days thereafter when I tried to resolve the issue.I spoke to Amazon cs and they were not helpful. They advised to charge it to 100 percent (well of course, right) and then advised to restart it with a hard reset (hold the power button for 40 seconds) but this does not help the battery issue.I do not recommend this item. Amazon needs to work on fixing this issue, as it appears to be a major problem. Just do a quick internet search and see that there are a bunch of other people dealing with the same issues. Amazon, please fix this.

Beach Lover,4,"This Kindle is Growing On Me
","August 10, 2019","I do not love change and I really wanted to replace my original paper white. So when the newest edition of the Kindle arrived, I did not like it at all. But the more I use it, the more I like it. I love that Good Reads is on it and easy to find. I don't love how small it is, but I love that it fits easily in my purse. I love how light it is. My older Kindle was much bulkier and heavier. I SUPER LOVE the battery life. The touchscreen is absolutely nowhere near as sensitive as a smart phone. So the touchscreen should be something they continue to work on. The lighting is good at night and outside, not great, not like my smart phone. But it's a solid good. I really like my case that goes with it. If I had the purchase to do over would I make it? Yes! Would I recommend this? Yes! If you get it and like it but don't love it, my advice is: Give it a little time. This device is growing on me. I like it a little more every day.

J. Watkins,5,"I love this thing!
","July 11, 2019","I was very skeptical at first because it was so small, and I didn't know how I would adjust to screen reading vs book reading. I would say within the first 30 mins  I was used to the screen reading and was quite comfortable using this device. With being able to get ebooks from my local library and the books that come with Amazon Unlimited, I'm completely enamored with this device...I read 6 books in the first week I had the Kindle! The lighting for the screen if wonderful, I've been able to keep reading a few nights when I've had to lay down with my daughter to help her get to sleep, and the low light doesn't bother her. The only odd thing I've noticed is that after a few weeks of use, the sensitivity of the screen to tap to go to the next page seems to be lacking. I'm having to tap twice a lot now because it doesn't change the page the first time I tap it. I'll have to keep an eye on that. Overall, I'm happy with this!

The one thing I liked better on my old kindle is  that my books were listed and I prefer that to book fronts.

I really enjoy having it. The light is great. Useful with either hand, solo. Right hand can tap to advance page and left hand can use a slide motion to advance page so either hand is good. Super light weight. I tossed a cover on it and really enjoy reading w it. I love that you can adjust the size and space of the lettering since I tend to read in weird positions you really can turn the device to any angle and get a good read out of it. Highly recommend.Oh also when you first get it, it's gonna go to an ad for a book EVERYTIME you wake it up. I went on Amazon and opened a chat with customer service and asked to remove the ads.

I always kept my Kindle in a case, never dropped, never got it wet, never had a single problem but suddenly it stopped working.So, I called Amazon custom service and asked were I could send it to be fixed and what they told me they couldn't do anything about it because Amazon doesn't have a technical support for it. They offered a 176 reais (Brazilian currency) gift card but a new Kindle Paperwhite at that time was around 450 reais. After that they cancelled my Kindle account, so I couldn't try to fix it myself, I asked for my account back and I never got it but the gift card is gone now and I never got it back as well.So I'm giving Kindle a new chance not because of Amazon's service or anything, just bc I really like to read.Kindle is great until they stop working for NO reason and you have to throw them (and your money) away.

I admit I did not carefully look at the size of this before buying it, but was shocked to see, when it arrived, that it was barely larger than my cell phone.  When I made the font large enough to read comfortably without my glasses, I got about two paragraphs per page.  Not acceptable for a fast reader.  Also the letters were not clear...honestly it looks like a cheap knockoff.  Fortunately there is a Fire sale this weekend for Father's day so I am returning this useless to me device and getting another 8"" Fire for $20 less than I paid for this!

","June 30, 2019","My first Kindle was a 2012 Paperwhite.  Loved that, was still using it, screen wasn't as responsive but battery lasted at least a week.  I've had it 7 years...decided to replace it with a new version.Disappointed in the new version I replaced it with.  When it was received I returned it because the battery only lasts approx 3 days (but it does charge fast!) and the screen sometimes freezes after a couple of hours reading.  The replacement behaves the same way with a +/- 10% improvement.  Evidently this is the new quality we can expect.  Still love my Kindle but oh so disappointed in the quality..

Amazon Customer,4,"I LOVE my kindle....but....
","July 25, 2019","When I first got my new kindle I was amazed at how light it is....but then quickly learned that it is also very slick! Easy to fumble and drop. I purchased a cloth cover from Amazon but discovered that it too was slick and added too much extra weight because its foundation is hard plastic. I like to read in bed....holding the kindle in one hand. It was fumbly and difficult to hold. I had difficulty changing the page with one hand while holding onto the kindle. The touch screen page turning was sensitive,  a little unwieldy and hard until I purchased a pop socket for the back of the kindle. ALL problems solved!! I do not recommend the cloth cover. It doubles the weight of the kindle and is also slick. The pop socket is the way to go here.As far as the features of the kindle....they are all great. It's quick and responsive.  It's easy to navigate and is intuitive. I do not use the light but can see how it would be handy at times. I am trying to reduce blue light since that helps with getting more and better sleep.I don't know if it's MY kindle or if this a universal problem but, my personal theme settings do not stay set. Suddenly things will revert to perhaps default settings for font, spacing etc. without warning. Annoying but not a big deal really. I do have to keep resetting my theme and I wish it weren't that way but am not willing to send it back over such an issue. Maybe I should.All in all, I love this kindle. It's all that I need and cannot see why anyone would need to spend a lot more money on an upgraded version. This one is light weight, compact, simple, easy to use and perfect for reading.  I do not recommend the cloth cover but highly recommend a pop socket for carefree use.

Josh,1,"very disappointed - flawed in design and not a great kindle. Wish I could exchange/return
","August 27, 2019","This kindle is pretty disappointing. I've given it time hoping I would adjust, but this kindle is just flawed. Some of it is getting used to the touch screen and just accepting the fact that when I have to reach for something and hold it with one hand, pages will skip ahead and the touch screen will pop up different menus. The main problem is that - with every book I have read so far on this kindle - it FLIPS OUT and will skip ahead in the book (more than one spoiler has occurred) and I will not be able to go BACK to the page I am on. When I touch the left side of the screen, it continues going further ahead. I have to let it sit for a minute or so for it to respond correctly. It truly ruins the experience and makes an enjoyable read frustrating. I wish I could exchange this kindle for my old one that broke, with buttons on the side.

David Terry,5,"Just as good as the older Paperwhite
","August 10, 2019","Lost my Paperwhite on the bus (an older version not the latest). Decided to go with the standard version now that it has lights. I frankly don't see the difference between it and the pervious version of the Paperwhite. Love it. Works great. Resolution is good too. (I don't read comics or high res image based books, just fiction/nonfiction.) Highly recommend it and the entire Amazon ecosystem. (Highlights, notes, whispersync, etc.)I would recommend backing up your MyClippings.txt file once a month or so. Although Amazon will sync your highlights and notes for books purchased they don't for your ""side loaded"" or personal books. All your highlights and notes are in the MyClippings.txt file, even those books you side load or send from your email address. Connecting your device to your computer and copying the file over somewhere safe will ensure you'll have all your notes and highlights.

JJ dreamer,3,"Long battery life is if you go through the steps to achieve it.
","June 18, 2019","I got my 2019 all new Kindle last week, and so far I'd have to say it's kind of nice and kind of lackluster!  I've had problems getting to the main screen, trying to get to the next section of the book with going forward went at times forward and also backwards which confused me. One big issue is the battery. It's hard to check level of charge and what not, but the biggie is the battery not lasting for weeks as stated. I found out that you can only get weeks long battery life IF you turn off WiFi, keep the backlighting low and such. So if you like a brighter display weeks-long battery life is out the window. If you have Audible audiobooks on account, these will clutter the screen thus making it harder to find just ebooks you have in your library. For those who hope to help you switch off the phone and television to aid in sleeping, it doesn't work as good as you'd think.

CanyonCarl,4,"Best Ereader on the Market
","July 22, 2019","This is my 3rd Kindle overall and 2nd Paperwhite. That alone should be enough to express my satisfaction. I deducted one star because it is slightly smaller than my last Kindle. It therefore does not fit securely into my old slightly larger cover for which I paid $39.99. Buying a new cover that fits and puts the Kindle to sleep when closed and awakes it when opened would cost me another $39.99 which I am not willing to pay. Instead I am using using duct tape to hold the new Kindle in the old cover and turning it on and off manually. It would have been so nice if Amazon had made this Kindle the same size as my old one.Nevertheless I highly recommend this Kindle. If it's your first, my criticism applies only to its size and not its quality.I used Amazon's trade-in program which brought my cost down to just over $46. That was certainly a plus

","July 31, 2019","Although touted as new and improved, it certainly is no replacement for the Kindle DX.  Once you have found a bookyou would like to read, you can change the print size to suit you, but since the overall size of the device is so small, thatmeans you can read less than a sentence at a time. It lacks control buttons, so everything has to be controlled on the screen. This makes it very difficult because it's hard to tell whereabouts on the screen you should press. I returned the device and managed to get my old Kindle DX to accept a charge again and I will gladly return to using the DX.

I love the built in light and longer battery life, as well. I tried the free kindle unlimited trial with it, but in my opinion, it didn't have any of the books I was looking forward to reading, so I cancelled it quickly to avoid forgetting about the end of the trial and getting charged eventually.I'll admit that I didn't read all the literature that came with it, so getting back to the home screen was a struggle at first because it wasn't obvious, but I eventually figured out that it's accessed from the top of the screen.

NUNO BARRETO,5,"One of the best purchases I've made in awhile
","July 12, 2019","I love this device ! Coming from the kindle app on a tablet I was a little concerned with the slower speed of the kindle device, but my concerns were unfounded. Yes, it's slower, but it doesn't affect the overall reading experience.  The size is great, it's about the size of a paperback, very lightweight and you can hold it with just one hand while reading without any issues. While this device has the lowest screen resolution of the remaining devices on the kindle family, I find that as long as you're not reading with the device an inch from your eyes, you will have no issues at all. Even with a small size font the text is perfectly readable and sharp. Compared with reading on an ipad, you have the advantage of having no notifications to distract you from reading, the screen on the kindle is much easier on the eye than a normal lcd and you can read in bright daylight without issues as there is no screen glare. Additionally, you can browser/purchase new books directly on the kindle, whereas on the ipad you'd have to open a web browser and go to Amazon's website to buy something. The built-in light of this device is more than adequate for low light reading or for reading at night. You can change the brightness in the device settings. The device also allows you to listen to audiobooks (from Audible) using wireless bluetooth headphones. I would say the only (very minor) drawback is that the battery life doesn't seem to be as long as advertised. I read for about 1hr to 1hr30m each day and with the backlight set to about 50% I get ~2 weeks of battery life. Again, this is a very minor issue, 2 weeks is plently and you can charge as long as you have either the optional charger, or a device with a USB port that you can connect the USB cable provided for charging.

The battery is great as well. The downfall is, it's black and white, so you want see color on the book covers and the screen is picky. Half the time when I turn the page, it goes backwards instead of head. Also, if you want to go to ""Home"", it is touchy. I found it is easier to be on a new chapter or where there's not writing on the whole top page. If there are words in the top, because that's where you have to tap it, then it tends to turn pages.  I also find I can't write reviews on it either. Just put the number of stars. To me, I'm not sure if it was worth the price I paid but I would buy again if the price was right.

Anyway, I finally relented and traded up.  Am I glad I did?  So far, yes.  I just hope I can get the same mileage out of the new one.  I absolutely love the paperwhite because I am an avid reader.

","August 17, 2019","As an owner of the last two generations of Paperwhite, which I still have, I can honestly say this less expensive version is an excellent alternative if you aren't looking to spend over $100. I bought this because my elderly mom has been staying with me while recuperating from surgery. She has had no problems with reading on it and prefers it to my Paperwhite that I originally let her use. It is very lightweight and the pages are easy to turn. I used it one night to read in bed so I could check out how it differs from my Paperwhite and I had no problems with reading in the dark. Yes, the print is a little different but no so much that if you didn't have a way to compare you would be bothered by it. Really, if you are looking for an inexpensive e-reader this is the way to go!
"
C_TexLive,4,"Love it so far!
","October 16, 2019","I was hesitant in purchasing an e-reader mainly because of the price...when books are free at your local library. However, the positives were the ease of use and ability to carry multiple books on the device and go several days without charging. I finally caved and purchased, and I have no regrets. The e-reader makes reading from a screen enjoyable and easy. I was worried I wouldn't get the same feel as a book, but this competes rather well and is way better than reading from a computer screen or phone.Another, positive is kindle integrates with goodreads so you can share passages, notes, etc with a community already engaging the book you are reading. This is very cool. I actually can't wait to load more books.

Jeri cullinan,1,"this is my second review of the all new kidle
","September 7, 2019","All-new Kindle - Now with a Built-in Front Light :  this is a downgrade from my 8th gen kindle fire. unfortunately the power button got stuck on that one so i had to get a new one. the pros are the new kindle is way lighter to hold and it does have the front light, it has the same size viewing screen but seems smaller. the font will not enlarge in settings. If you are going to replace your old kindle fire with this new paper white, you will be disappointed.you cannot get video on it or any of the new ones.  i like my video. it will not open to my book mark i have to restart it to get my book back i got a refund on this so i cant complain but be aware, just cause its newer does not mean its better.also its hard to find the books in the so called library. i hate it

Janet C,4,"ok but disappointed in the touch screen
","August 16, 2019","I've been using this for a few weeks now and I would say it's okay, though i dont like it as much as my older generation one. I dont use the light because I dont read in the dark and I dont like looking at backlit things, but i suppose it could be useful for some. I think the battery life is adequate, but not as good as I hoped (the reason I upgraded was my old Kindle wasn't really holding much of a charge anymore) . My biggest complaint is with the touch screen because I do not think it is very responsive when I'm trying to turn the pages. I usually have to tap it 2-3 times in order to change the page. Twice it's become so frozen i had to hard restart it, which sucks since its so new. Also, definitely turn off all the home screen recommendations if they annoy you.

Taoufik Guerouate,4,"Touch screen slow
","May 12, 2019","I have this kindle for over a month now. The battery life is amazing, built in light makes reading very comfortable, and your eyes are not tired. The only problem I have is the touch screen. Very slow to answer to your touch. You need to hit icons twice or three times to get a response. Not related to our WIFI (we have a very fast wifi). Hope that Amazon will fix this with an update.

Christopher Keller,1,"Highlights Amazon's greed and device is not worth it,.
","July 30, 2019","Can't download apps.  I mostly get my books from the library via their downloadable app.  Too access their e-books I have to borrow them and download them on another device with the library's app on it.  Then I can read on my kindle e-reader.  Not difficult, but requires an extra step and an extra device.  Device won't connect to public wifi either.  This is a bigger problem.  Obviously, Amazon could fix these problems, but apparently they feel that to do so would cut into their profits.  I could deal with these problems, but this reader is extraordinarily flimsy compared to the much more durable kindle fire.  The ONLY positive thing I can say about it is using it is easy on the eyes.  For some this might be enough. This is a two star device I down graded to 1 star.  Buy a kindle fire unless you don't care about price or quality!

Robyn,4,"Basic, but nice.  No glare. Easy to use.
","July 20, 2019","I like that I can actually read outside now. I've been a kindle fire user for many years, it was fine, but I couldn't ever see the screen outdoors.  How did I make the jump from Fire to ereader? I only would use my fire for reading. So the rest of the features were wasted on me. Plus, everytime I went to use it, it was dead. I'm not the best charger. That is another perk of the ereader- the battery life! It lasts much, much longer. Also, it doesn't ""go to sleep"" as quickly as a Fire if you happen to set it down to yell at your kids/husband/pet for the millionth time since you sat down to read.So far I like the switch. This reader is very basic. Very. This works for me, but if you will have FOMO from the lack of features, you may want a fancier version.

Darryl withrow,3,"You get what you pay for.
","July 19, 2019","After being a loyal Nook fan I decided to move to Kindle as the future of Barnes and Noble is shaken at best. The Kindle I bought is very small and that’s my biggest complaint.But for the money it’s okay. I cannot justify spending $200 on a item that is simply a reader when I can get tablets for that price that do so much more. I do not like the fact that there is no page number display and I found the claim of battery life WAY over stated.i get only 2 days on a charge and I only read one hour a day. The screen and fonts are great and easy to read.The size is both a blessing and a curse as it’s easy to transport but difficult to hold. All in all you get what you pay for and as an E reader it’s fine.

Mitchells,3,"Decent for the Price
","April 19, 2019","I love to read & needed a new e-reader to replace my 1st generation Nook Glowlight. B&N decided to no longer support it so I couldn't purchase books anymore. This Kindle is pretty good, I love how I can read it outside & inside. It's very user friendly & auto connected to my Goodreads account. I just wish I could dim or completely turn the light off sometimes, and that it had more space. It states 4GB but, of course, the operating system takes up about 1.5GB. Really doesn't leave much space for my books. Luckily my Nook Glowlight still works & has a micro-SD card slot so I can store my faves there. Decent for the price.

Martha Rivera,3,"Not to happy
","August 4, 2019","I had an older e-reader for about 6 years, I loved my Kindle, but the battery life was getting shorter and shorter. Then I couldn't down load any books, so I figured it was time for a new Kindle. I decided to trade in my old one for a new one. When I got the new one, I was very excited but that ended quickly. First I do not like the new front light, it isn't very bright so I am having a hard time reading my books. Second, I couldn't down load any of my books which I found out that I have 5G wifi and the Kindle doesn't connect with it. I have to go work and down load my books and heaven forbid that I finish a book at home during the weekend, I am not able to read any more books till I can connect to 3G wifi. So my new Kindle is put to the side and I have to read my books with the Kindle app on my phone, I guess I could have saved money in the first place by just using my phone.

Bethany,5,"Overall Happy!
","April 17, 2019","I'll be honest, I wasn't sure about this when it arrived. I had an OLD keyboard kindle that I bought in 2011 & used often bc I don't care for the ""tablet Kindles"" to read on. This new version looked way smaller than I expected. But when I compared the screens, what made this smaller was the lack of keyboard - the reading screen was identical. I was worried I'd not like the touch screen page turning, as I didn't want to finger print up the screen but it's been fine. You can just tap, no need to swipe, so it's not a big deal. I really love the backlight, which my older kindle did not have. So - I opted to keep the new version & trade in my older one. I would still like the option if buttons to pafe turn, but otherwise I'm pleased with my new purchase!

","August 2, 2019","I've wanted to purchase a Kindle for a really long time, but just never found the right time with my budget. This year I decided that I would splurge a little bit and get myself one for Father's Day. (Thank you family! And Thank you Amazon and AMEX for the deals!) I am very happy with my Kindle so far. It's easy and enjoyable to use. I love how lightweight it is and the battery life is amazing. The non-glare screen makes reading comfortable in different lighting levels. And I'm really glad that I got the one with the built-in lights so I can read at night without bothering my wife.I will say that I have found some quirks with the lights. I usually read during the day so I keep it off (because the lights are somewhat distracting) so when I go to read at night, I have to find a light/flashlight in order to turn the lights on. Not a deal breaker, but kind of annoying. The other quirk is sometimes the touchscreen clicks over multiple pages at a time. Again, more annoying that anything when you have to click back to find where you were.Overall, I love this Kindle and am glad I finally got it. I'm sad that I didn't buy one earlier so I can read all the time like I do now.

Nicholas Cairns,5,"Makes reading easy again
","July 26, 2019","I'm closing in on my 30's, and I've spent most of my 20's reading far less than I did as a child and teenager. It's frustrating because I do miss the experience of falling in love with a book and spending hours in worlds that aren't this one. A big part of my lack of reading is how little time I have to dedicate to sitting and reading, as well as finding myself in situations where I COULD read, but can't because I don't have a book with me. The Kindle has given me the opportunity to bring books with me again. I've blown through 9 books so far, and I only bought this thing not quite a month ago. A big part of that has been utilizing the Kindle app, as well, so I can spend small amounts of time catching up on reading too. Any time spent waiting for a ride, or for a meeting to start, or even while microwaving a hotdog like the lazy adult that I am, I also spend reading. I'm loving this thing, and I am feeling really good about the money I spent on it. Worth every cent.

","August 12, 2019","I wanted to get an additional kindle for my high schooler but the battery life on this is terrible. We haven’t even read anything yet and the battery depleted the next day. My original kindle barely ever has to be charged. I thought this one would be an upgrade but it is  small and pretty much useless due to having to constantly be charging it. I had even purchased an audible book hoping that it would read along with the text for my child who is dyslexic and you can’t do that either so I am dusting off the original kindle and probably returning this.

Jill,4,"Better than the Paperwhite
","June 30, 2019","I bought this kindle after my original oasis's screen cracked. The 167 ppi is definitely noticeable and blurry if you're used to reading on a 300 ppi screen. I would recommend increasing the boldness of the font to reduce the fine lines and blurriness. The touch screen does not always recognize when I lightly press it for page turning. That may just be my experience, but it gets very annoying when I assume the page turned and end up rereading the same page again and again.I would definitely recommend this one over the 2018 PW because the design appears more modern and there isn't any distracting ""kindle"" wording on the front. It also has a backlight and it seems that the plastic screen may be sturdier than the glass screen on the PW. I also really like how small it is. It fits easily into my jeans back pockets and is very portable.

I do wish they had a slot for SD card for extra storage but it is a great product for sure.

Sam237,5,"First time kindle user
","June 17, 2019","This is my very first kindle and I love it. The main reason I purchased a kindle was because I didn’t want to keep buying physical books. I was reading “It” by Stephen king at the time I decided to purchase this and that’s a huge book and I would just read it when I was home because I didn’t want to carry it with me. This is small and I can take it with me wherever I go. Being a kindle owner we get the lending library which is a cool perk but you can only rent one book a month, even if you return the other book before the month is up, but then there’s the subscription for unlimited which I’m thinking about trying. The touch screen seems a little weird to start with because I can’t remember the last time I used an E-ink device but I got used to it right away. It’s easy to read especially at night before bed with the backlight and it’s not bad on the eyes. Over all for a first time buyer of this product I’m very happy with my purchase, I read on it every day.

","July 31, 2019","It might be a little premature for me to write this review since I've only been using my new Kindle for two days, but I'm quite happy with it so far. This was an ""emergency"" purchase that I made when my old Paperwhite bit the dust after nearly 7 years (thank you to Amazon for giving me 25% off with my trade-in).The battery life doesn't seem any better or worse than my old Kindle. (Note to avid readers who have complained about the battery not lasting for four weeks: it stands to reason that if you read for several hours a day ever day, you'll have to charge it more frequently than you would if you read less.) It's a straight reader without the bells and whistles, which is really all I need. The on/off button on my last Kindle used to stick, this one does not. My last Kindle required a PIN to be typed in each time it was turned on, this one does not. The words at the bottom of the screen of my last Kindle looked slightly faded (from day 1), but I don't have that problem with this one. New features that I love are the book cover display, as well as suggested titles based on my reading history.All in all, I'm pleased to say that this model is comparable to my previous one, which lasted years longer than I expected it to. So far, no complaints.

I usually visit the library and pick them up....very easy. It's all well and good one can download a book and read it straight from the device. Great. The unit is easy to see and works well in lit areas. The features that don't work very well are the typing and searching online for books. It is incredibly slow and the response time is painful. I don't expect it to be lightning fast, but this is crazy.  I tried looking for free books to get but that is almost impossible. Looking deeper into the whole Amazon empire, there is Amazon Unlimited which you have to pay for, and Audible (another Amazon money hungry company that has a fee). I have too many bills and I don't need another that's not worth it. So until I find a way or place to download for free, I'm going to continue to go to the library and get audio books from there. It's so much easier and there are thousands. Unfortunately as of right now, this new Kindle is a very expensive paper weight,

Patrick Nielsen,5,"Nice Unit!  I Read A Lot More As A Result!
","July 23, 2019","Two years ago my wife hinted that she wanted ""a Kindle"" - so I bought her both a Kindle Fire 10 (which has many tablet like features such as a browser as well as some other apps) AND a Kindle Reader.  I figured that she'd try them both, decide what she liked best … and we'd share the ""other"" device.  Well, turns out that she likes the Fire - which she uses for email, browsing, etc. - AND she likes the Kindle Reader specifically for reading.  I gave her Kindle Reader a try as well - and decided that I'd like one for myself.  The unit that's covered in this review is the Kindle Reader I purchased for myself.I'm happy with the device.  I read it daily - and find that I only need to toss it on the charge every 5-6 days - so the battery life is good.  The  screen is very legible - even in when reading outdoors and in direct sunlight - no complaints about that at all.  I really like the way the device ""behaves"" when I'm reading it.  It remembers right were I was when I put last put it down, I love that I can adjust the font size easily (my eyes ain't what they used to be!).  The backlit screen is great for reading in bed (when the rest of the lights are off ...).  I can read while my wife sleeps without bothering her.  I love that finding and downloading new content is so easy.  I'm reading a lot more since I started using a Kindle than I did prior to that.  The Kindle works for me in situations that a ""real"" paper book doesn't.My only negative comment (if you want to call it that ...) is that it appears that they made minor modifications to the physical case of the device.  The Kindle Reader we purchased a couple of years ago had a slightly ""boxier"" enclosure.  The enclosure of the new Kindle Reader I purchased recently appears to have been redesigned such that the edges are more rounded.  Being that I often hold the Kindle with just one hand - I sort of liked the old case (which wasn't quite as rounded) a little better.  I found that it was easier to manage ""one-handed"" then the device I purchased recently.  It's a nit, and something I never would have noticed if I didn't have an older model on hand for a comparison.Either way - I'm very happy with the purchase of my Kindle.  If you're looking for an inexpensive E-Reader that's small and easy to use - without it trying to be more than just a vehicle for reading books, etc. - you can't go wrong with the Kindle Reader.

Victoria A. Spring,1,"Really disappointed by this product.
","August 8, 2019","It is sad that features added to make reading on the Kindle have made it harder to use. The on/off button is ridiculously small and hard to push. When you turn the Kindle off it is hard to hold the little button for 7 seconds with out having your finger slip off. Then, when the finger slips, you get an add and have to hold it down for another 7+ seconds before it will take you to the screen shut off.The add says you can read with only one hand - not happening unless you lay the device down on a table - you are required to swipe the page to move on to the next page.I really miss the way my early edition Kindle stored my library by names of the books rather than pictures of the covers - It makes the library hard to work through now 30 pages instead of just 4 or 5 pages. I miss my home page button and the buttons on that made turning the pages quick and simple.I was assuming that I would be getting an ebook reader, this thing is just designed for adds.Battery life is less then my early generation Kindle!

If I pick it up by the left side to move it, it scrolls dozens of pages back if my finger so much as touches the screen.

R. K. Dillon,4,"Adequate replacement
","August 21, 2019","My old Kindle suddenly died after 5 & a half years of heavy use.  I was in a panic & just ordered the first thing I saw for a price I thought reasonable.  I didn't compare models to the one I'd had & may have made a mistake.  This one is o.k. but I don't like it as much as the old one.  It may be a matter of new policy on Amazon's part - the screen savers are ads for new books, not abstract pictures of reading/writing-related objects.  You have to use 2 steps to get it up & running.  It occasionally stops tracking the 'time left in book' which I like to have all the time.  But, as I said, it was an impulse buy that I didn't research before requesting.

Amazon Customer,3,"Turning a Single Pages is Tricky Sometimes
","July 16, 2019","Overall i love this kindle. The backlight allows me to read it everywhere and at any time. I had one of the first generation kindles before upgrading to this one so i'm not interested in doing anything besides reading, with the occasional word lookup in the dictionary. My complaint, and why I gave it 3 stars is because sometimes when you go to turn one page you'll end up somewhere pages away. I've done this somehow enough times to leave this review and make sure that i know turn on the ""display page number"" feature when i'm reading so i can find where i left off faster. This is def not the better of the two kindles that i had but for basic reading like i do i love it.

I really like my version 3 but, was very happy to upgrade to my paperwhite model.  I now have the 2019 10th generation (as well as my paperwhite) and to be honest I'm not very satisfied with this one.  It is slow to start up, compaired to my paperwhite model.  The touch screen is temperamental, sometime it take my touch to change the page and other times it doesn't.  Then some times it will appear to not accept my touch and when I touch the screen for the second or third time, it will actually skip ahead two or three pages.  I like the device just not a much as my paperwhite model, I would trade it for a paperwhite in a heartbeat.

They may seem negligible to most, but for him they were a barrier.2. requires a blue tooth headset.  Again something that has to be plugged in (to power source) and then the reader has to 'find' the headset each time.  The second time I tried using it, it would not find the headset.

The great thing about this technology is that its easy to read in any light, from full sun to middle f the night.  Battery seems to last forever so you do have to plug it in once in a while so not to be surprised.  Simply one of the best devices to come out for a hard core reader.  We probably 6 to 8 books a week which is a heavy thing to carry around.  The white allows you to carry may a couple of thousand.  Nice for traveling or just going to the doctors office.

I remember someone having a regular Kindle paper white that read the pages.  So I got this one for that purpose.  It only reads if you attach it to a Bluetooth.  I have the echo so was thinking I could synch them but it really defeats the purpose.  The iPad does it with kindle app so was thinking this would do the same.  I was wrong.  Also didn’t realize this was so small.  I think I will just stick with iPad unless I want to read a free book with my prime membership.

Touch screen is so-so  and the battery life is good. This device is not as user friendly as my old one. I find having to wade through the screenshots of the book covers to be slow and unneeded.

This kindle has the light and costs a lot less then the paper white model. I feel the page turn buttons work promptly and the text seems just as clear as the higher model.

","October 30, 2019","I do like the back lit screen.  The charge cable receptacle seems a bit tight, so I wonder if I'm forcing it.  My biggest complaint is that stuff keeps popping up on the screen, and I have to clear it several times before it goes away .  This wasn't the case with the previous Kindle.  Some pop ups seem to be connected with an option to get word definitions, which I accepted, to my regret.  Definitions of words on the spot is a good idea, but not at the expense of having persistent pop ups, which apparently are stimulated by page turn touches.

I didn't technically see what happened, so I'm going to say... ghosts, probably.)Anyways, I updated with the latest model and am IN LOVE WITH THIS LIGHT! I came in with a lot of trepidation, to be honest. I expected it to be hard on my eyes in the night, but it isn't, and can dim enough to not bother my wife at night. No more cell phone light with a pillow to block the light polution.My only complaints are:- That backlight is on constantly unless I manually adjust it. That makes it great for transitioning from day to night as I lose track of all sense of time, but is a drain on the battery that I'm still getting used to.- The powder-like finish on most of the plastic is not very scratch-resistant, so when I brought it with me on a trip, riding in a pocket, it came out of my pocket with enough scuffs and scratches on the body that it looks like I've owned this thing for years, not weeks.All the same, if you read as much as I do, it is well worth the price for a nice paper-like screen and soft backlight that won't hurt your eyes over hours of reading.

I've been a Paperwhite fan since the first one came out, and currently own 2 (both previous generations).  I wanted a new one because my oldest one was getting finicky.  But the reviews on the new Paperwhite weren't so great (in comparison to the previous generation), and didn't seem worth the upgrade.Prime Day, I see this Kindle at a great price.  It's now got a built in light, which is the main reason I've always had a Paperwhite.I love the smaller size, and the weight of this model.  I only use my Kindle to read books, and dont even notice the lower PPI.But the light is too ""blue"" and bright for reading in bed.  Even at the lowest setting, its harsh :(.As you can see in the picture, the Paperwhite light is softer.Not a deal breaker at all - its really a matter of personal preference.  I'll still get plenty of use out of this ~ it just wont be my bedside Kindle.....

","June 15, 2019","My husband has a Kindle PaperWhite reader, but I've always used my iPad to read books. It's a little heavy and uncomfortable at times though, so I'd been considering buying a Kindle for myself, but I didn't want to spend a lot of money. When I saw the new 10th Generation Kindle on sale I decided to give it a try, and I ended up buying one for my daughter two days later as well (early birthday present).  It's very similar to the PaperWhite and the screen is almost as bright. There's less storage, but I almost always use Kindle Unlimited to read, so I don't think that will be a problem. I haven't let the battery completely drain yet, so I can't say how long a charge lasts, but I already know it lasts longer than reading on my iPad.  So far I am very pleased with my purchase.7/6/2019 It's been 3 weeks, and I'm still very happy with my purchase. So is my daughter. I've been reading through the reviews, and I honestly have not had any of the problems that other customers have listed. I use my Kindle for a short while just about every day, even if it's only to read myself to sleep at night. I love that I can hold the Kindle with one hand, and simply touch the right side of the screen with my thumb to turn the page. It's so much easier than reading on my iPad, where I needed two hands to hold it for any length of time, and to swipe the screen for the next page.  I recommend getting a case, there are lots of options for the 10th generation and many are inexpensive.

MO Tiger Fan,4,"UPDATE
","October 12, 2019","I rate this E Reader less than 5 stars because of similiar cons with other ratings.  I do have suggestions.  1.  Instead  of using the screen touch to change pages, swipe from the left to right to go to next the page and from right to left to go to the previous page. 2. To save battery life (a) change the backlight to a comfortable level ( recommended 13 is right for me), (b) turn off WIFI until you need it but one drawback is you will have to re-enter your WIFI password to turn it back on.  This is not a problem for me since I only need WIFI to buy Kindle books. Check battery level so your battery doesn't drain to low.  (c) power the Kindle off after reading.  Since I bought the bundle, the cover I have is magnetic so when I open the Kindle  after turning power off, it opens to the current page I  am reading. and (d) if you don't want special offers appearing and willing to pay more make sure you select that option when making purchase.  I do recommend purchasing the bundle to save and  getting everything you need.  I am satisfied with the Kindle after learning how to use it.  Also recommend reading the Kindle Guide to avoid having to search for basic information.UPDATE TO MY REVIEWUpdates automatically download and install when connected to WIFI.  If you turn off WFI to conserve battery life, you MUST turn WFI on and periodically check for recent updates .

I had to get used to some things on it, like looking in the dictionary, but I've gotten comfortable with it.  But I'd have to say, overall,  I'm very satisfied with it.  I still, down the road, want to get the Paperwhite.

","August 11, 2019","I had been anti-e-reader for so long, I always wanted to stay loyal to paper books. Don't get me wrong, I still love and cherish physical books, but I found myself not reading as much as I wanted to because of the cost and space involved with storing physical books. I purchased this after a friend raved about her Kindle experience, and I'm so happy I did. I've already read 3 books since I received the Kindle in the three weeks since the Kindle arrived, and I am halfway through a 4th. Kindle Unlimited is a great deal and I'm glad for the opportunity to try out some amazing books for free.

","June 23, 2019","Love the built in light, great for nighttime reading.  Not a big fan of touchscreen, takes some getting used to. I liked the side buttons better for turning pages, gave me more the illusion of reading a “real” book. But I’ll get used to the new touch.  Battery has a long life. No need to charge as often. Also easier to see how much battery life is left. The reason I gave it 4 stars is because the new unit loses from time to time for no reason the WiFi connection and I have to go into Set up again to make the connection. I do not have the problem with any other device.

It’s just a matter of one owns preference. Purchased yesterday, already read half a book. Even read during supper last night, just propped it up (solo supper, wasn’t in a family atmosphere, kids grown/gone). Might add, I purchased mine at Best Buy, really wanted it yesterday and not wait for it to be shipped. Hey it was the weekend-prime reading time. Would have ordered from Amazon if during week.

","September 19, 2019","At first I thought it was too small, but have grown used to the size.  The size is nice for sticking in a pocket, except I found it ""unlocks"" and will move pages or sections ahead if you are not careful when in a pocket.  Menu navigation was confusing at first, but sort of got used to that.  Main issue is that the screensaver/off screen is a constant barrage of ads - many for books I would never read.  Folks walk by, assume I am reading a romance novel, and the taunting ensues.  I think at $80 Amazon made enough off of me that I don't need constant ads for items I am not interested in ruining my reading experience.

Jon W. Schonblom,2,"Hyper sensitive screen.
","July 24, 2019","For me this device is a great disappointment.  I would gladly trade it in for my old device.  The problem, for me, is that the screen is so sensitive that several things happen.  Often when I try to turn a page Kindle turns several, sometimes back and sometimes forward.  Finding where you left of is a trial and error process.  On occasion simply waving my finger over the screen, not touching it, will turn the page or several pages.  It is a handicapped device and is sensitivity challenged.  I can live with it but I don't like it much.

","April 18, 2019","Coming from a Kindle 3G (with the keyboard). Backlight is OK, could be a little more evenly lit across the screen. Touchscreen is a great upgrade! Takes a little getting used to as it isn't as sensitive as most tablet/phone screens, which is good as it prevents accidental touches from unwanted action. Item does feel a bit cheaply made (one edge seam is a little raised, not sharp, just feel unfinished) but I guess this is to be expected for the entry level model (you get what you pay for). Overall works well, a definite upgrade from my previous Kindle which is still going strong after 7 years!

C.B.,1,"not possible to invert colors to black background, for night reading
","August 5, 2019","It's absolutely absurd that you can't invert the colors for a black background with white text. By far the most common time for people to read is before sleeping, and the bright white screen emits a lot of blue light and is one of the best ways to cause insomnia. I'm not talking about a full fledged night mode like iPad and the other more advanced e-readers have (or even a smart phone has), I had expected just the simple capability to reduce the light. Technically, it's extremely easy to invert the colors, yet a big company like Amazon could not do so.

Also seems to be slow to process when I touch the screen. Many times I have touched the screen as it comes on and then it syncs, so what I thought I chose is not what comes up. Also when I touch the screen it reverses the black and white sometimes. What was white turns black, etc. Not really happy with this purchase.

chumbo,5,"Best Kindle so far
","October 2, 2019","I've been using Kindle for almost ten years, starting with the ones with keyboards, touch screens and paperwhite later on. However, my last update has been in 2015 with a Paperwhite, so I was looking forward to getting a new Kindle since my Paperwhite was starting to grow old.I would consider myself a Basic Kindle user, I use it only for the purpose of reading, so all the extra bells and whistles of the paperwhite (water-proof, 4G, more storage, higher resolution, etc) didn't call my attention. Just the basic Kindle with built-in light looked good enough for me. And it delivered.The new Kindle is unbeatable, and for the price it's a no-brainer. If you use a Kindle only for its core purpose (e-book reading) and don't use all then you will be very satisfied. The display, contrast and light are great, cover works fine, page-turning is smooth and the build quality feels really good.I'm really happy with it, I just don't need anything more.

NJ Marshmelo,4,"Front light kindle reader
","September 28, 2019","I have a first gen kindle fire. I am afraid to lose it and prefer reading this way. I love the kindle fire . I thought this would be a good way and affordable way to put my books and reading in one place. I was intrigued by the front light idea. I dont like it as much. The touch screen is not really as  user friendly. The pages are not as easily turned. The lack of sharpness is troubling. But if I didnt have my kiddle fire first, I would be glad to have it.

Unfortunately, you can only listed with a Bluetooth device which I cannot seem to get connected.  This one does not hold a charge like my Kindle whitepages. In addition, I was able to add the time to my pages without going back to the home screen, I cannot find a feature for this on this new kindle. In addition the storage seems to be much less than my other kindle. I wish I had kept me kindle whitepages....

","May 14, 2019","I purchased this Kindle for my husband. He was resistant at first to use an e reader, but is now enjoying it! He noticed the ease of taking his streamlined Kindle on a recent vacation in place of a cumbersome book. He also found it very readable in the sunlight. The light is great for nighttime reading. The only negative comment I have heard him make is that it’s not necessarily intuitive in terms of use. Overall, we are both fans!
"
John E.,4,"Yeah! Light!
","May 26, 2019","FWIW I also own the previous ""unlit"" base model of Kindle.  i purchased this one for the light, an on that front this new Kindle does not disappoint.  There are 2 very minor negative differences though: 1) when starting it up after some time it goes into a ""warming up"" mode before it presents the ""swipe to unlock"" dialog; and 2) the touchscreen sensitivity seems lower and possibly not as near the edge of the screen.  Like I said, those are very minor things -- all-in-all I am very pleased with this new Kindle.

","July 29, 2019","I am very satisfied with the new Kindle.  I didn't need anything more than this, which is why I did not go with another Kindle that was more table.The touch/swipe screen is taking just a bit of time to adapt to since I am accustomed to the buttons on the original Kindle gen 2 device.  The muscle memory of the ""next page"" and ""previous page"" took a while to purge.  Battery life has been unbelievable!  I am an ""old dog"" so I am having to learn some new tricks on this device, but they are logical, and I am sure a person with more experience with this style of touch/swipe actions will have no trouble adapting to the system.I expect my level of satisfaction will rise as I become more familiar with the new actions.

If you buy a budget model, you’ll obviously get something that’s not as good as its higher-end brother. Having said that, this Kindle is great and reads just fine! Who cares about the 167 ppi or the backlit screen? Whatever, the text is legible and the battery lasts at least a week. If you have any problems with that, then I can’t help you.

The battery life is also not as good as previous versions.I love Kindle and can't be without it. However, this version doesn't live up to the legend.

Zeynep,3,"Not bad, but not 5-star happy
","August 12, 2019","The device arrived quickly (more quickly than expected, for which I was glad).  Everything was simple to set up and it's easy to use.  2 reasons why I didn't give it more stars:  when I go to turn a page, sometimes it turns more than one page and then I need to find my spot again.  Also, the words are very light.  I understand that I bought this knowing the ppi wasn't as good as the New Paperwhite.  In reading reviews before purchasing, it seemed as if the ppi level wasn't a big deal (and it may not be to some), but the words are a bit lighter than I prefer.  This isn't a bad purchase, but I do wish I had waited until the new Paperwhite was on sale.  However, for not wanting to purchase the new Paperwhite for its price, this one was okay.  Just not top-notch.  I won't tell people not to purchase this, but you may want to wait until the new Paperwhite is on sale.

Most of the time I get a chance to read, it is at night before I go to sleep. So I have been pretty much only using it with the light on for at least an hour and a half daily, before I had to charge it 2 weeks later.The screen is extremely easy to read in any kind of lighting condition and I really like the fact that it is so lightweight too.

I’ve had to charge it maybe twice in the last 2 months. The backlight is the key selling point for me. I read indoors, outdoors, right before bed and I enjoy that there is not glare while outside and the backlight is just the right brightness for me to not have to squint while reading at night. This kindle is a must have!

","May 2, 2019","I like the smaller size.  The back lighting is a must.  I ordered this kindle before it had the back light and sent it back, just too dark to read comfortably.  I do have one problem with this though.  Instead of swiping the screen to turn a page you are supposed to tap or touch the screen.  That's fine, except I find that there are times I have to touch the screen multiple times to get it to turn the page.  Very annoying!

While the built-in light makes it easy to read, the touch screen can feel a bit unresponsive at times (like, it either lags or doesn't recognize my swiping). I can't be all mad, since I know there's a big difference in how a smartphone handles versus a Kindle; I just hoped to be wowed more than I was. I guess it's an e-reader at most. Would definitely recommend to anyone getting back to reading, or anyone who should begin.

My library opens with pictures of the books instead of just a list, and I would prefer a choice there.

Side note: I just found my first generation Kindle in a drawer, and wow -- has it come a long way! Still fantastic, amazing, and worth every penny.

It isn't clear that this is what the ""special offers"" means and it is the default option. They don't make it obvious that it was an option. I really hate the ads and was disappointed when I first used the kindle.The hardware itself is great. I ended up paying and additional $20 to remove the ""special offers"" option and now it is great.

","August 5, 2019","I just got this kindle to replace my old one.  On my old one I had a bunch of games that I had gotten to play on my kindle like majong, solitaire, scrabble, etc.  When I got my new kindle none of my games would download.  I had to have customer service call me and then I found out that the new Kindles don't support these games.  So I couldn't play the games I had bought for my Kindle and that I could only use on my Kindle since I can't play them  from my cloud.  Apparently I have to buy a kindle fire just so I can play the games I bought and used to be able to play on my Kindle.  Fortunately for me I hadn't been able to trade in my old Kindle so I  can still access my games on that.  I do love the built in front light on my new kindle, and this kindle is a lot easier to adjust the settings on.  My old kindle had buttons so the touch screen is easier to use, but sometimes I accidentally turn pages without meaning to, and footnotes can be a problem. You have to tap it in exactly the right place to get them to come up and it usually takes me a few tries.

The light is a great perk- not backlit, so there’s no eye fatigue like there is from reading off a screen, but enough that I can read in a dark room. The only thing that took a little getting used to was the square shape (for some reason I want it to be more rectangular, like a book), and at first it seemed a little *too* small, but the ease of tossing it into even my smallest purse makes it worth it and it really doesn’t impact my reading at all.

The case I got has a strap that is a little tight, but that's not the reader's fault. The only thing I would suggest is to offer a sepia tone for the backlight. It makes it easy to read in low light (especially because you can control the brightness level!) But reading in complete darkness made my eyes tired after a half hour or so.All in all, a good basic e-reader (I've never bothered to get the fancy ones). I got it on sale for about $50 and have had it for about 2 months now.

So it bought this.  Yes it is only black and white, and it is small, but you can adjust the text size.  I can turn pages with one hand.  Easy to take with me, and battery seems to last a long time.  Great for travel, or reading outside.

Quite a few videos mentioned reading text is not much difference.  I found the text is not sharp as I expect.Yes I like the size, weight, holding feel. But the display is a bit let down.  Not sure paperwhite looks better.

","July 2, 2019","I'm really not sure what the improvements on this one were to be honest with you. Compared to my older version which got destroyed from being flooded in the kitchen, this one is smaller. Which means I need another cover for it.The Battery doesn't seem to last quite as long.And one of my biggest pet peeves, is that unlike the kindle fire, you can't leave a review for amazon and goodreads at the same time.

","May 1, 2019","Small & comfortable e-reader. Great for outdoor use. Non glare screen is the reason I bought one for me and one for my wife. We both have Kindle Fire's 3rd generation but can't read outside or at the beach. The type is very clear but I have a magazine subscription and the All New Kindle doesn't show color. The battery does not last for weeks if you read a lot. As a travel e-reader it's great. Good price.

","August 3, 2019","I have a Kindle Fire that I use to read books, among its other capabilities, but I later wanted just the eReader Kindle. I struggled with this, because it seemed frivolous--the one I already had can do the same things. Eventually, I gave in and got the eReader. LOVE IT!! I prefer the screen that looks more like paper--no glare in the sun. It's SO MUCH SMALLER (and lighter) than the Fire, that its easier to carry around and fit in my purse. I won't stop using the Fire for its other purposes, but I'm so glad I gave in and bought this one as well. Well worth the money.

Brianne,5,"Great little device
","August 28, 2019","I gave my mom my Kindle Fire 2nd generation and went to this e-reader. I had a kindle keyboard before my fire, so I was excited about the built in backlight. I had the e-reader for a few weeks now and I love it. I saw some of the other reviews about the slow touch screen and the lack of audio, but keep in mind it is a budget e-reader. The touch screen is actually nice, I love the lightweight feel of the device and the fact I can carry it easier than my old kindle fire. For the audio, it comes with a Bluetooth option, so the possibility of connecting Bluetooth headphones or speakers is high. Overall for the price the device is very nice and I have had no issue

I am able to lay down on the couch, put a pillow on my chest and be so comfortable reading now as opposed to getting neck strain or butt pains in chairs.The only con I can think of is that sometimes the touch sensitivity is lacking. This is not a capacitive screen, its eink and you need to get used to it.

More than once I have had to find how many pages it had skipped.I also like that I can just turn on my Kindle and start reading without outside light.  I like that you can adjust the brightness. I haven't yet adjusted the font but I will try that also, since the small print is trying.  I have just realized how to turn the Kindle completely off.  I have just been putting it to sleep.  I have had to charge battery already, but now If I turn it completely off while I am not reading , it will not use battery power.  I haven't been able to connect it to my hearing aids as my fire is connected.  I will continue to try.

My only problem with it is it's both too touch sensitive and at times not enough touch sensitive.  I'll be reading, and haven't touched the screen and the home page or some other page will pop open.  Then at times I'll tap it to turn the page, but it is frozen and I have to tap it multiple times to get it to turn a page.  So a little more work needed on this model.

I take it to the beach, take it to work, take it everywhere because it's so cute and small and can fit in all of my purses.

Christopher Asturi,1,"you cant charge it and watch it at the same time if you need to be hands free
","November 13, 2019","I need it at work to read tech manuals but you cant use it hands free while charging. Also, if you don't turn the page soon enough, it shuts off. Then, when it's shut off there are advertisements on the screen that you can't just swipe and remove, you have to pick it up and turn it back on. For me this was a waste of money and has turned me off to amazon products so much that it's unlikely I'll use amazon for anything in the future.

It works like the others, although this is the smallest one physically but the screen is still the same size which is great.  The main problem is that the touch screen is not as responsive as my other ones which I find annoying.  Also the backlighting control is a bit harder to get to.  This is still the only way to read books and everything else is great.  I actually like the ads for different books as it gives me some new ideas for different authors.  All in all a keeper.

This is the second time in a couple days I've had to charge it.Another thing I struggle with is that in order for me to go back to my library, I have to let the special offer screen come up and select read now in order to get to my home page.

I like the fact you can borrow books from Amazon and read them and then return them.  The limit of 10 books at one time is reasonable also.  I have read 4 books since getting the Kindle so I have been pretty busy reading.  It is also easy to take along versus a book, you never lose your place on the Kindle as it takes you back to the page you were on before closing or timing out.  I guess as all things it's a matter of getting acquainted with the Kindle and experimenting finding out just how it works.

This one isn't able to invert the colors (black paper, white letters) which I believe the Paperwhite can. Initially, I thought the battery life wasn't great, but after I charged it and used it some more it lasted a long time, so I think it just needed to calibrate first. It's going on 2 weeks without a recharge now. The touch screen is a bit slow, but I think that's part of keeping the battery life long and costs low, and it honestly isn't much of a hindrance. It's very lightweight and easy to carry around and read it even while eating or laying down.

zen_reader,2,"Would not recommend.
","August 4, 2019","I do find this item easy to read, but the software driving it is inept and clumsy.  I find myself going around in circles trying to do the simplest things.  Furthermore, it irritates me to no end that, in order to turn the screen fully off, I have to hold the switch in for fully 9 seconds.  I find myself preferring to read my books in the Kindle app on my iPad.  So much easier.

Golfer2002,5,"Great device for the money.
","May 2, 2019","I chose this kindle based on the features I was looking for. So far so good. I like that you can adjust the font, size, and backlight brightness. My other kindle did not have a backlight so I could only read it while sitting under a bright lamp. This one I can read anywhere - even at the beach. And so easy to download books from my public library. I highly recommend.

I was stuck between purchasing this and the paperwhite version, I’m glad I went with this one since it has everything I need on top of it meeting my affordability needs.

We are using the kindle for leisure reading and for studying college textbooks we purchase on amazon.

Cyndie L. Tozzo,2,"Battery Drains too fast
","August 3, 2019","I want to love my Kindle. I love everything else about it. But the battery drains too fast. I googled and thought maybe the cheap case I got was the problem. So I ordered an official Kindle cover. The battery drained from 100% to 30% in only 2 hours of sitting on my table. Because of this I may not fill it up with books any more and eventually not use. This is very disappointing.
"
Tammi,5,"Overall Great Case!
","September 3, 2019","This case is a great cover for your kindle. It does not add unwanted weight or bulkiness to your kindle while protecting it. The charcoal gray is great and hides all dirt. The stone color shows your fingerprints and gets dirty easily. Overall it’s a great case. I have dropped my kindle a few times and thankfully the case kept it in tack. Id definitely recommend.

Rattlesnake,5,"Greatly Improved
","May 30, 2019","The backlit screen makes all the difference in the world.  I've been using a Kindle for reading outdoors and in good light and a Fire tablet for low light conditions.  Not any more.  The new Kindle is perfect and doesn't weigh more than a couple of feathers.  Also the touch screen has been improved along with the battery life.  Not sure what they can do to make the next generation any better.

The jacket cover pictures get in the way of trying to find a book I think I've read. Kindles are amazing! A true stroke of genius.

Reader from Chapel Hill,1,"Defective AND a disappointment
","July 30, 2019","I previously have used a Kindle Fire; had no problems, but device simply finally died after 10 years of excellent performance.Ordered this simpler Kindle; it was a disappointment on almost all levels - poor lighting (contrast poor and options to change limited), too small, slow to switch pages - and in addition, it was defective: would not allow return to menu or home page, ebook simply remained on screen despite all attempts to change screen.

Roger W Bunn,2,"WARNING:  VERY POOR BATTERY LIFE
","July 27, 2019","The new Kindle battery life is terrible.  I took it off the charger at 5:30 pm yesterday and only read for about 45 minutes.  By 10 pm it was down to 18%.  It would literally have to be charged a minimum of once a day, if not more.  I have had it for about a week.  Other than that it was a nice reader, but the battery life is unacceptable.  Amazon did make it very easy to return, though, so good on them for that.

duck reader,4,"Not the old Kindle
","August 17, 2019","My 8th Kindle-----has not measured up to expectations.  Although I reduced the brightness of the screen, battery life is in the 2 to 3 day time frame, not much different than my previous Kindle.  Page turning can be a bit erratic At times, touching twice is necessary and other times it may jump several pages.  As compared to prior Kindle, content requires several actions to load---opposed to being there when Kindle ready to read.  You have replaced it but the replacement is about the same.  However, will keep and continue to use.  Very much of my daily activities.  thanks

J. Sanford,4,"A good electronic reader.
","November 6, 2019","This is my third Kindle.  The built in light is great.  The touch screen takes getting used to.  Touch the forward page too long and it will take you a chapter or two ahead in a flash.  I miss not being able to advance the page from either side.  You advance the page on the ride side and go backward on the left side.  Overall, a good product.

TPMM,5,"eReader for Book Readers
","April 21, 2019","I've owned several Kindle products and the new Kindle with built-in front light is my favorite for reading books. It's designed just for reading and the non-glare screen is easy on my eyes. I also own a Kindle Fire HD, but prefer the eReader for books and magazines. The price makes the new (10th generation) attractive, but know that the psi specs are lower than some other Kindle models. I don't find the ""economy display"" a problem, but for a better display look at the paperwhite models. I like the small form factor of the new Kindle. It fits well in my hands and for anyone with a stigmatism the size means less eye movement and easier reading.

Angela McDaniel,5,"Great for reference books
","June 27, 2019","This is my first Kindle. I needed a reader for those times during writing when I needed to look something up in one of my reference books, but didn't want to switch between screens. (Or have a really small screen to take write on.)  This Kindle has filled that niche perfectly.Yes there are some glitches, but to me they are minor and not always noticeable. Sometimes the page won't turn, but that could just be my light touch on the screen.The backlight works well in direct sunlight and in a dark bedroom. It's easy to hold in either hand. Though highlighting can be a bit touchy it still works well.Overall I am enjoying my Kindle.

My new white kindle just arrived, and I am delighted to discover that the text on my new basic is crisper than on the paperwhite.  I made the right choice and saved a few dollars.

Bula girl,5,"No more glare!
","August 3, 2019","I love my new Kindle! I used to read books in my 2nd generation Kindle that didn’t have a built in light and used a clip on book light. There was a lot of glare and it kept my husband up because it was so bright. Plus the clip would slide off the Kindle and that’s not fun in the dark. I don’t read at night with a lamp on so to have an adjustable built in light helps a lot! The touch screen is much better and not as sensitive to touch which makes reading more fun. The screen is smaller but easier to buy books and get to your library. If I accidentally touched the screen on my old Kindle I would lose my place but this new Kindle does not do that and you can change the setting to show the page number. Love my All New Kindle!

Drew Russell,5,"Best value for Kindle
","October 5, 2019","Quite simply: I upgraded from a Kindle Keyboard (circa 2011) and am blown away with how far these devices have come. Backlight, touchscreen, audiobooks, bluetooth, ample memory.. the list goes on. It's lightweight and seems durable. I don't even notice the ""lower PPI"" screen. I use it for reading and it's crystal clear. Don't look further: THIS is the best bang for buck when it comes to devices like this around.

Amazon Customer,3,"Kindle Paperwhite
","August 31, 2019","I like the design features of this Kindle, but my major problem with it is that the Kindle Unlimited subscription offers books I'm not interested in reading, and Goodreads, which is also installed, which does offer great reads, is quite expensive in terms of purchasing the books to read on Kindle. Scribd cannot be loaded onto this Kindle, either.  Bummer.
"
Carol,4,"Works great and was easy to switch over
","August 17, 2019","The size is small and so is the screen.  The page tuning function requires a firm tap so does not turn on the first tap for me consistently, which is anoying as the screen is small.  The battery does not last as long as my old Kindle paper white.  The screen saver seems to be a tiny bit larger than the screen so it leaves air bubbles.

Ritchie,4,"Love it with minor flaw
","August 14, 2019","The only reason I give it a 4 stars is because at the bottom left of the screen, it will give you the approximate time until the end of the chapter or end of the book. I leave mine for end of chapter. It does a great job and usually fairly accurate. However, in more than 1 book it's worked great until about halfway through the book it will give a time to finish the chapter (for example 5 minutes) but it doesn't change page after page after page. It ends up being 3 or 4 times that to finish the chapter. The first half of the book it's pretty accurate but the second half it isn't at all. Minor flaw but overall it's great!!

","July 2, 2019","I'm extremely frustrated with my All New Kindle.  While the size is nice, the light is fine and all the features work as expected, the touch screen is miserable.  I'm a pretty fast reader, and when I want to ""turn a page"" I want it to work.  This Kindle sometimes requires me to touch the screen three or four times, sometimes rather forcefully, before the page will turn.  Other times, I think the page has turned and then find myself reading the same page over again.  Obviously, this interrupts the flow.  I've never had this problem with my other kindles and am extremely unhappy with this situation.

","April 22, 2019","I was looking forward to this one but after the side-by-side, it's not even as bright as my Paperwhite.Now, I'm not the Kindle expert, so maybe this would've been the case all along but with a front and back light, I was expecting it to be brighter. The fact that it's not, is really the main reason I'll be sticking with my Paperwhite.Also, it's physically smaller than my Paperwhite and I would've needed to buy a new case for it if I were keeping it.

Tenaria,5,"They keep getting better.
","August 23, 2019","I have owned a few Kindle readers and many Kindle Fire devices. I was very surprised and pleased that this one came with a backlight. Makes it a lot easier than the clip-on light I had to use with my old one (or I would switch to a Fire for night reading). It can be a little sensitive about page turning (it likes to skip ahead a few pages every now and again) but I’m getting the hang of it. Wouldn’t trade it for a stack of paper books.

Bryan Gonzales,2,"This is not the paperwhite
","June 30, 2019","To be honest I was truly disappointed with this purchase and most of it is my fault I was looking for a Kindle paperwhite and this is all that was available at the store where I bought it.  next time I will definitely order direct from AmazonOverall it’s a good Kindle not a paperwhite and the battery life gets drained very fast when using the lit screen.Touch controls are a bit sluggish but then again it does what it said out to do provide an easy to use e-book experience.

","September 2, 2019","This kindle is terrible compare to my old Kindle 2. Do not like the touch screen, it does not always produce the same results for the same touch.

Pros: size fits perfectly in my hand, incredibly clear screen for reading, perfect for the pool (not to close to the water though), good response time for downloading books, wifi. Overall a great gift!  Next purchase will likely have color screen and water resistance, but an EXCELLENT value for money.

Amazon Customer,4,"Sooo Convenient
","June 20, 2019","All I can say is I love it. I wish the screen was just a tad bit bigger but overall I can't complain. It makes reading a breeze and it comes with some handy little features. The prices for books do confuse me sometimes because some books will be cheaper in actual physical paperback then the kindle edition which I don't understand I think Amazon should figure that out because a physical book should cause more to print out than an e-reader edition it should give u the option  to price match but that has no bearing on the device itself just a fare warning the kindle book is not always cheaper than the physical book for those looking to save money on books.

LAJReeves,2,"Not what I was expecting
","August 12, 2019","because of the paper-white's reviews, I was expecting something more substantial, something closer to the hype listed after 'Product Details'.  The unit is so light and small that I keep dropping it on my chest while trying to read.  The battery only lasts for hours, definitely not for weeks, as advertised.  The display is not high-contrast, but kind of gray--just more or less gray.  I would never use the words 'sharp' and 'black' or 'crisp' to describe this kindle.  If I hadn't waited so long to get it out of the box, I'd have probably returned it.

Ardell,5,"Can read outside

While I no longer have my old paper white to compare, I really don't notice  a difference in reading novels. Perhaps if I was interested in viewing images, the difference in resolution would be apparent.

Old Birdwatcher,4,"I miss my ""old"" Kindle
","September 9, 2019","The only reason I got another Kindle was because my old one from  2011 didn't turn pages reliably any more. It had had very heavy use and was just worn out. I find the page turning function very irritating on the All New Kindle. Touch and you turn a page, whether you wanted to or not. Older hands are not so steady as they used to be and I find that I turn several pages, ready or not. If I could, I would go back to my old Kindle.I do like the light function though. I often read at night and the extra light is nice.Also, the pop up dictionary feature would be nice to turn off. I would rather access it when I want it and not when a finger hoovers over a word.

","August 10, 2019","It's very lightweight but in a cheap, poorly made way.  When you swipe it blinks out and then resumes the next page.  You can only have a light background and black lettering and I would prefer the opposite; it's easier on the eyes in the dark.  It goes to sleep with suggestions for books to buy on the screen and that seems desperate.

Robert S. Herman,4,"Further from real books that earlier versions.
","May 25, 2019","I had a keyboard Kindle for years and liked the manual keys for scrolling and turning pages - little chance for mistaken ""swipes"" that might take me somewhere else in the text. It also had a little more heft.The new Kindle is light, but it's also can fall off of surfaces easier. I've found that, at times, the touch screen seems sensitive to handling without actually touching the surface - leaving me further ahead or behind in a text.Set-up was simple, and the texts I'd gathered for the earlier edition were easily transferred.I think this is mostly a matter of just getting used to something new and a little different

At night, I prefer white text on a black background to reduce total screen brightness to my eyes and particularly my spouse if I/we are reading in bed. Kindle app on my phone has this mode, but All-New Kindle does not. In fairness, this was not included in the features advertised by vendor, so I didn't expect it (though one would think this is only a software issue, not a hardware limitation). Still, I wish Kindle would just update the software and add this feature. Otherwise, a very nice reader, especially for the price on Amazon Prime Day.

No where in the advertising for the ""Bundle"" did it say that.  I would like someone to contact me about this.  I feel I am owed the 25% discount on the purchase price.

Carol,5,"Great Kindle!
","October 4, 2019","Love my new Kindle. I had a very old Kindle Fire 1st generation that finally died. It was always next to impossible to read it outside. My new one is as clear and easy to read outdoors as a book. The only improvement I would like to see is dropping the ads for new books every time I open it. It’s kind of a pain to have to go through the ads to get back to the book I’m reading.

Debonair,3,"Battery Life not correct
","April 26, 2019","Although it is advertised that the battery on the new Kindle lasts for weeks and not hours, mine has only lasted for a few days.  This is no where near the battery life of my original Kindle (ver, 4) that I had for 7 years.  That battery did last for weeks.

ROSE F.,2,"not very responsive
","April 23, 2019","While I enjoy the smal size of the product I 'm finding it difficult to get the product to go to the next page when I tap the page.  I also miss the ability to change the screen to night mode - somethiing that is available on my Kindle fire.  Probably would not purchase another.

Stephen L,5,"Must have for any reader
","October 8, 2019","I was a little hesitant to switch over to the new kindle given that it’s much smaller than the original.  However, I’m glad I did.  The size isn’t much of a factor and I am able to read the text clearly.  I was able to trade in my old kindle for this one for a discount through amazon.  Definitely recommend for any avid reader!

statmomma,5,"Another great kindle...
","July 29, 2019","I really like the weight and the look of this Kindle. The backlight works perfectly in the sun or shade and the battery lasts a really long time. I had the original kindle and several more in between this one and the first. I am very pleased with this.  The only negative is that I sometimes swipe more than one page forward or back. I also haven't figured out how to search within a text but that is my problem and not the kindle's.

Amazon Customer,4,"Touch screen is “touchy”
","August 18, 2019","I have poor eyesight and the lighted screen on this Kindle is great. The only thing I really don’t like is the response of the touch screen. It doesn’t consistently work and I have to keep tapping it. Then suddenly it skips a couple pages or goes backwards. It’s just not very good.

Uman,5,"Excellent
","November 24, 2019","Very clear & easily adjustable text. Battery life a bit shorter then my older kindle, but that's a fair trade-off for the great built-in light, which is much better (kind of more uniform) then on my older model. It's really lightweight and easy to hold with one hand. Just wish they'll come up with something  to turn pages hands-free :-)

Amazon Customer,2,"Plugged in over night but not charging
","October 3, 2019","I have had this for over 2 months.  I love it, except for when it needs to be charged.  Not sure what the deal is, but when I charge it over night and when the little light is on, it never seems to charge.  Not sure if it is me or what.  It is very frustrating that it is plugged in but the screen is telling me that it needs to be charged.  It shows a battery with an exclamation mark.  I try to hold the power button for 30 seconds or more for it to turn back on.  It turned back on once, but not this time.
"
Kenna,5,"AMAZING!!!
","October 7, 2019","Oh my heavens! I am a college student who is obsessed with reading, but it's difficult to find time to read between homework and studying and working, but this kindle makes it so easy to breeze through books.I read a few hours a day and the battery life holds better if the kindle is on airplane mode. The touch screen isn't very sensitive to touch, but it's not made to be the same as a tablet or a smartphone (which I didn't expect, but if you're expecting it that's not how it is). You can also upload documents and PDF files and such, so I can study right on my kindle!
"
ddep,2,"Touch screen too touchy
","July 13, 2019","I purchased a new Kindle because my old one kept skipping pages back and forth without my touching them.  The new Kindle I received does the same thing, but even worse.  While I am reading a page, it will go forward one or more pages or back one or more pages automatically.  This becomes very annoying as it happens quite often.  I do not know how to correct this .
"
Emily Tapp,5,"Love this - goes with me everywhere.
","November 25, 2019","I love this and use it so often. I love using kindles for public transportation and traveling - and now I love using this paper white before bed too. The adjustable back light is awesome - I appreciate being able to continue to read without having to have a separate light on. I bought this as an upgrade from the original first generation kindle. A worthwhile trade in.

Debbie Bashore,5,"Great Item
","June 17, 2019","Wow, this is my second Kindle and compared to the first one I had ( it lasted 10 years) this is great. I love the built in light and I don't have to charge it all the time. It is a lot smaller and more compact and I would recommend it to anyone. I love my new Kindle. I am 64 so I need the bigger print and it so easy to work and the downloading of e-books happen so quickly it amazes me.

","November 15, 2019","When advancing pages, it flickers to white text on black.  But there is no way to set it to white on black, or dark mode... which is definitely my preferred mode of reading.  Simple technology that obviously is already capable due the flicker back and forth when advancing pages.  Otherwise, fine.

","October 30, 2019","I can’t really comment on the battery life as I have only changed it once and used a shirt time. The touch screen isn’t very sensitive...I’ve had to swipe several times to change the page; one swipe doesn’t do it.
"
Juan C Mata,5,"Great for the price.
","June 2, 2019","Overall, a great, simple product. The Kindle is light-weight but feels solid. I keep reading how long the battery life is, but to be honest, battery life percentage seems to drop fairly quickly. I haven’t had it long so maybe it’s not as significant as it seems. I also tend to have the screen on the brighter side, which I know is probably hurting battery life. For me, the screen is fairly dark so I have to have it almost full tilt. Again, that may just be my personal eyesight issue.Overall, I recommend it, especially for the price.

It keeps slithering away from me, and it's smaller size causes accidental page-turns. Battery drains quickly so I plug it n every morning.

Mim,3,"A downgrade from previous Kindle

Tyler,4,"Liking it so far.
","October 22, 2019","I’m really liking it so far. The size is just right and that battery lasts a long time though not nearly as long as I expected. It’s a little sluggish and awkward when trying to do anything but reading (like going on goodreads or navigating the store) but it’s pretty much what I was expecting. Of course it goes on sale right after I buy it and I could have gotten the paper white for the same price, but besides that I’m pretty satisfied.

I like it all to be there and not have to go to a totally different site to find the additional information. Spoiled, I guess.  Also, I have a problem getting the page to advance at times.

Where the white part of the screen turns black and text goes white for reading at night. The paperwhite seems to have it. Why can't this one? Come on man. Does anyone know a way to install it by yourself? Like a jailbreak? It's seems extremely simple to do. But no. Amazon ""could not"" put that in there.

While lightweight, the formatting is not particularly user friendly.  And while the touch screen is ok, it frequently skips pages or jumps sporadically ahead.  My biggest concern however is the battery life.  I find that I need to charge this device daily while my old paper white could last a week on one charge.  Perhaps I received a defective device because this is certainly not an improvement.

","October 27, 2019","This is my 4th kindle device.Pros: light weight, clear screen, built in light, you can create different custom page displays (I have one set for only reading and one for reading and watching TV)Cons: it has voiceover but not text to speech, the voiceover is much more cumbersome-it reads everything on the screenOverall I am pleased with this kindle.

Kevin D.,4,"Nice reader
","August 31, 2019","Great little reader. I like the size because it is easy to hold and fits easily into any bag. The only thing that could be better is the screen resolution. The text isn’t very sharp in darker conditions.  I guess that is what I get for buying the cheaper one.

Karleen,4,"I'm perfectly pleased
","July 7, 2019","I really like how compact this kindle is. It is easy to hold and very easy to see. I ordered this particular one because I didn't want any bells and whistles and definitely no ability to download nonsense to distract myself. The battery life is good. The Only downside I can tell is that sometimes the screen is either too sensitive or not enough. I may have to tap more than once to change the page and then it will skip ahead several pages. Overall definitely worth the price. Does the job!

","August 19, 2019","I’ve only had it for a month or so and it’s already having issues! Sometimes the touch screen won’t work at all. Other times I will open up my book and the pages will start turning by themselves. I’m incredibly frustrated to already be having problems with something I purchased so recently!

","August 29, 2019","What is wrong with my battery? I have had this basic kindle for 2 weeks, and the battery life is nothing as advertised.... ""weeks not hours""????

Tracy,4,"perfect for traveling!
","September 27, 2019","this works good for exactly what it’s made for - reading. sometimes i have to remind myself where some of buttons/functions are and occasionally the touch screen seems a bit slow, but it’s never a huge inconvenience and once you start reading, you’ll forget about it anyways. also i love how small, portable, and light this is, while still allowing you large text options if you need it. overall happy with this purchase and excited for it to be with me constantly while traveling.

","September 7, 2019","My prior Kindle was maybe 10 years old so this new one is a huge improvement.  I love the touch screen, the light and just the ease of use.  I don't have to turn on WiFi everytime I want to search the store and then remember to turn it off so it doesn't run down the battery.  So glad my daughters gave this to me for my birthday.

Jim J,3,"size
","August 28, 2019","Too small, not what expected. Details of this model on Amazon are not very good. Ease of use was all touch screen instead of the page of buttons on the side.

Tom Everitt,3,"Kindle Store not as advertised
","June 6, 2019","The touch screen has a lot of features, but, everything has to be intuited except to swipe to open which you know because there is a command.  Everything else is by trial and error.  I find the library difficult to navigate as compared to the 1st generation.The purchase came advertised with three months of Kindle Store but the unit itself says only 1 month and like most things Amazon there is no where to go to get it fixed

","July 9, 2019","I decided to get this kindle to save some money on books. I love reading, but hate re-reading books I’ve already read and spending $9+ on new books. This kindle has solved all of my problems! Some books aren’t nearly as expensive as hard copies, and you can even read some for free! Ever since I got it I have read every night. Definitely worth the purchase! The screen works great, I love the adjustable light, and the settings for the books are so handy. 100% recommend!

","September 1, 2019","This is my first Kindle.  I had heard for years that Kindles were made for readers but didn't really understand what that meant until I had one.  It reads like paper, works in any lighting, and feels nice in the hand.  Super light weight so it's better than carrying most books.  I took it on vacation and read on the subway & on the beach and it was perfect in all settings.  In love with this little device.

beezhan,4,"Very happy, would recommend to anyone!
","August 3, 2019","It makes me happy. you wont regret purchasing. the battery life would be fine but Amazon's add says weeks of battery life on one charge and I get about a week. granted, I listen to audio books for about 50 minutes a day and occasionally use the light. so just keep in mind weeks of battery life would be just reading and no back light.

Alice Shepherd,5,"The light is great!

H.Edelmann,4,"Generally pleased.
","August 11, 2019","When turning a page my KIndle occasionally goes crazy and advances several pages. The device rarely indicates  a 'location'.i.e. percentage read, page number, etc. This makes it difficult to locate my place when there is a malfunction. I am a heavy reader and find I must recharge more frequently than with my old model. Must be the lights?
"
Amazon Customer,3,"works fine but hard to get accustomed to it.

","August 30, 2019","I owned an older version of Kindle and recently upgraded to this version. I have found it to be easy to use and I have had no problems with the battery life or the built-in lighting. My only complaint is that it can be awkward to hold without accidentally hitting the touch screen, but that isn't really a problem. I've also been able to download books from my public library easily. Basically it's what you expect and if you want a Kindle just buy it.

It's easy to read on and small enough to carry wherever. The only thing I would point out, which isn't really necessary to complain about it, is the reaction on the touch screen. It's a bit delayed but it's not a deal breaker, at least for me. I'd recommend this kindle to anyone wanting a kindle on the cheaper price.

","June 25, 2019","I used my old kindle about half for reading and about half for playing word games, solitaire, etc.. Maybe I'm atypical but I really enjoyed the feature. To find it's gone is a great disappointment.  I'll keep using my old one for that until the battery dies completely but I  doubt that I'll be considering another kindle when this new one goes.

Books I bought on my Kindle appeared on my IPad but the books I had previously bought on my IPad didn’t transfer to my Kindle until recently. Maybe it just took time for some reason.

No book light, no going into another room, just turn it on and start reading.  I would recommend this to anyone who likes to read and doesn't want the cumbersome book.

That could be me getting used to the sensitivity but just throwing it out there .

","August 10, 2019","I hate it! It only lets me read 2-3 pgs before it freezes. It has to be laying flat for the touch screen to work. And it's too small! Also, it's only a touch screen, so it gets fingerprint s all over it. I prefer the old style with buttons on the sides.

Agustina,5,"Great Choice for a First-Time Kindle User
","August 7, 2019","This is my first Kindle ever, and I'm more than happy with it. One thing that isn't as good as I hoped for is the battery life, but it's still pretty good considering that I used to read on my iPad and I had to charge it every night. If this is your first Kindle, and you're a bit on a budget, I highly recommend this option. You won't regret it!

Taylor M.,1,"Amazon and their anti-competitive practices
","November 1, 2019","So I searched amazon for a series of books I was interested in buying. Amazon then shows me this series is available on the kindle unlimited. I’ve been thinking a purchasing a kindle for some time so gave this one a shot. It’s terrible. $89.99 is crazy for how bad this is. The e-ink screen feels like something from the 90s, the screen quality is so terrible you can count pixels. 167PPI to be exact. To give you an idea that’s about 5 times LOWER than most mobile phones these days. The best part is after I received the kindle. I went to download that series that now was no longer free and I had to pay for each book. It seemed like a marketing scam completely. Also when you search for a book ( the better e-reader made by Barnes and noble ) you need to scroll before being plagued by amazons kindle adds and product recommendations. Amazon is a fraud. From fake products to promoting their own products before what I distinctly searched for shouldn’t be allowed. I will never purchase another amazon product after this experience. I highly recommend you save yourself time and money and don’t buy this.

Jeanne Whitehead,1,"Paper white regularly experiences changing port issues.
","July 12, 2019","Amazon does not stand behind this product in my opinion and from my experience..  They will send you a refurbished replacement, which is not covered fully by amazon.  I bought the kindle warranty for the 6” paper write, when the port no longer charged the unit,  they sent me a refurbished replacement.  That replacement now has the exact same problem,an unacceptably loose charging port, which renders the product useless. Extremely disappointed in what  was my go to reading device.  Amazon has changed, and not for the better.the better.

N. Drennan,2,"Very lousy battery life
","June 17, 2019","The battery life is absolutely horrible. It would go to 10% in less than an hour of reading. I would have it fully charged in the morning, unplug and close the case, sending it to sleep mode. It would be at 14% or less when I returned home in 8.5 hours which meant I had to hook it up to charge it before I could read or try to read while it was hooked up to a charger. I turned the light to 4 and turned on airplane mode. Nothing would make that battery hold a charge. So much for staying charged for weeks.As I bought it at Best Buy and returned it there. The person I spoke to said that they had several returned due to battery issues. I was told I may have gotten one from a ""bad batch"" and they were willing to exchange it. I took my money back and will use my Kindle Keyboard which I have had for 11 years and still works extremely well. I just wanted a touch screen and a light. I am very disappointed in Amazon in this ""New"" Kindle.
"
fran,5,"It used to be TOOOOOOOOOOOO touch sensitive!  But all that has changed now.
","July 3, 2019","My Kindle is now EVERYTHING I want!!  Got a call from one of Amazon's amazing customer reps who suggested I get a cover for my Kindle.  The cover is very thin and doesn't really add to the bulk of the device. (That was a concern because I prize the portability of the device.)  But, most important, the ISSUE I EXPERIENCED REGARDING UNINTENDED FLIPPING OF PAGES HAS TOTALLY DISAPPEARED now that I have a cover!!  Not sure why this is so - it just is!  And, the cover keeps my place in the book so that I don't have to use the on/off switch at all, now.  My rating has happily gone from one-star to five-stars.  I am so happy with my Kindle now!  and I thank Amazon for providing the perfect solution.this is my original review:  I really hate this Kindle!  It's much too  touch-sensitive and flips pages  back or forth if I even Breathe on it!  My old Kindle that had a button for changing the page forward or backward was MUCH better mechanically.  But with every book I read on this Kindle, I've experienced unintended page flips -- and sometimes even several pages.  I had read that Amazon was releasing the Voyager 2  with buttons this year -- but there's no sign of that release.  I would certainly buy it when and if it becomes available.  But, for my purposes, I don't want to spend hundreds of dollars just to get a button on a new iteration of the Kindle.  The size and weight of this Kindle are great and allow for easy portability.  But I'd never recommend it to anyone and am really pissed with this device and it's uncontrollable page flipping.
"
Maya,3,"OK
","July 18, 2019","I was very disappointed in this Kindle. The only other one I have had was the model with the keyboard. It stillworks well, but I decided I would trade it in and get a newer one. A big mistake. I have been using either the8 year old keyboard version or mostly my Fire 8 HD. I tried to read with this one and had difficulty with the""touch pad"" being slow to respond, and a lot of other issues. I had it working and had adjusted font etc. It justdid not feel right and would not hold as much as the old one. It is packed up for return. I cannot imagine usingthat thing comfortably for reading after using a Fire tablet unless all someone has used is a Kindle e reader.  Iam sure it is a good device, just not for me.Ok, so I purchased another thinking I could use it for listening to audiobooks. It just doesn't hold enough. I will keep it, but never recommend it.
"
John Spahr,1,"How complicated can you get?
","June 5, 2019","It seems the Kindle geeks never heard the line ""If it ain't broke, don't fix it"". They have taken the popular features of previous Kindles and trashed them and the current Kindle models are no exceptions. For example, where previous Kindles featured a library of your books, it is now very cumbersome to navigate through to find your library of books you have read. The majority of space on the Home page is mostly trying to get you to buy more books (based in Amazon's judgement, not yours) instead of being able to search easily for ones you want.  It is just a very confusing and difficult machine...
"
Ianeta,1,"A brick at month 13 - consider this purchase a disposable as-a-service buy.
","April 21, 2019","Warranty ends at 12mo, my kindle was like the many that froze days after. One thing is paying for kindle-as-a-service, but don't forget you will be stuck disposing of the hardware. The thought of kindles ending up in land-fill because of the crash rate is quite troubling.

","July 8, 2019","My husband bought me one as a gift and it's definitely good in bright light, but without an internet connection (which I learned is not Wi-Fi), I cannot access my public library and transfer free books. So why is Amazon charging more than $100 for a Kindle that is no better than a hand held book?

TheTeller,1,"Useless Without WIFI
","August 3, 2019","Despite saying there are plenty of ways to download your Kindle and Audible content via USB, its all a lie.  I've spent hours trying to download this stuff via USB since my new apartment has no wifi yet, and the fact is with all the ""protections"" now, its impossible.  Their help vids don't work.  I own this content, but can't access it because Amazon is so paranoid about piracy that they harm the user while the real pirates continue to offer the stuff I bought for a simple mouse click on torrent sites.  Thanks for nothing Amazon.  Guess I'll just have to wait until I buy that new $100 router.

I know it's slower than paperwhite for speed but not a real problem. I like all the improvements and for a basic Kindle.  Great to have light so reading in the dark a benefit over the older version of Kindle. Size great (fits perfect in my purse) and take it with me every time have to wait any length of time.

Juju,2,"Prefer the gray slate back lite model better
","June 21, 2019","I loved my slate gray background and the back light.  It cut the glare dramatically.  This would be improved if the option for back light only was built in.  That way the glare in lite areas would be diminished.  Yet there would be the option to turn on low front lighting for night reading.  For those of us with light sensitivity the loss of back light only is really felt.The back light feature is the whole reason I went with the e reader.

","May 10, 2019","Having had my new Kindle (my 3rd) for two months, I feel comfortable with my conclusions.  The new home page may be ""aesthetically pleasing,"" but it is NOT user-friendly.  When will designers learn that every change is not necessarily progress?  That goes right along with my second complaint that the battery life is not as long as my previous one.  I debated about buying an iPad mini instead of a new Kindle, and now I wish that I had!.
"
Gina Sharar,2,"Very basic reader
","July 19, 2019","I recently wrote a review (but cannot find it so don't know if it's been posted). In it, I gave it an additional star for the built-in light and another for the touch screen. After several more days of using it, I've downgraded those stars. For one, when I flip the page, the screen annoyingly changes for a split second to black with white letters if I'm on the white page, and to white with black letters if I'm on the black page. It totally breaks my focus. As for the touch screen, as someone else mentioned, I have to touch it sometimes repeatedly to get to a new window.  I'm probably going to return it simply as it's a chore to use.

grannysbooks,2,"On/Off button hard to find
","April 22, 2019","I bought this newest kindle for my mom because of the promise that it holds the battery charge longer (which it does). However,  she can’t stand it because she can’t turn it on or off by herself because the on/off button is too small and she can’t feel it or see it. She has to wait for me to do it for her.  I’m so disappointed! I don’t know if it’s a design flaw or if she just got one that wasn’t made correctly. If it’s part of the design, the engineers should take into account that older people who don’t see as well and/or don’t have a good sense of touch need something a little more obvious to help them turn the Kindle on and off.

The free subscription was tied to my Amazon account.  She received 1 month free when she tied the kindle to her account.  This month I was charged $9.99 for an unlimited subscription for a kindle I don't own.  So my daughter received 1 month free and then paid for 3 months.
