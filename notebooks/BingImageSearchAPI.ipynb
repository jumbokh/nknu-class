For more information, see [Bing Image Search documentation](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/rest/api/cognitiveservices/bing-images-api-v7-reference).\n\nYou can run this example as a Jupyter notebook on [MyBinder](https://mybinder.org) by clicking on the launch Binder badge: \n\n[![Binder](https://mybinder.org/badge.svg)](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/Microsoft/cognitive-services-notebooks/master?filepath=BingImageSearchAPI.ipynb)\n\n## Prerequisites\n\nYou must have a [Cognitive Services API account](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/cognitive-services/cognitive-services-apis-create-account) with **Bing Search APIs**.
